						Work
					</h2>
					<p>
						I'm a co-founder of <a href="http://peopleskillsforgeeks.com">People Skills for Geeks</a>, where we teach a no bullshit approach to being happy and effective. I also help others with their ux and product strategy as one half of <a href="http://fluidcircle.net">Fluid Circle</a>. Previously I served as an Agile Coach, helping nudge people towards better ways of working together.

					<h2>
						Writing
					</h2>
					<p>
						I wrote "<a href="https://fluidcircle.net/zasoby/30-dni-scrum/">30 Days of Scrum</a>" a series of articles in Polish about the basics of Scrum. I wrote several <a href="http://fluidcircle.net/case">case studies</a> about how companies use Agile. I wrote "<a href="http://www.computerworld.pl/artykuly/383300/Trzy.filary.zwinnego.zarzadzania.html">The Three Pillars of Agile</a>" for Computerworld Polska. I co-translated and published Jurgen Appelo's "<a href="http://fluidcircle.net/zmiana">How to Change the World</a>".

						Agile
					</h2>
					<p>
						I've spent a long time helping people be happier and more effective using Agile. Here's how the lead coach at Sabre <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q66lrF22_cc">described working with me</a>. For a while I was a SAFe Program Consultant (SPC). SAFe is not evil.

						Programming
					</h2>
					<p>
						I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/michalparkola/3card-holdem-estimator">poker odds calculator</a> that can handle 3-card hold'em. I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/michalparkola/faces">simple face recognizer</a> using <a href="https://cmusatyalab.github.io/openface/">Facebook's OpenFace library</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/michalparkola/redirect">minimal url shortner using nodejs</a> while at 9livesdata.  I wrote a prototype for a <a href="https://github.com/michalparkola/unilog1">journaling/log app called Unilog</a> using Python/Django. I wrote a Go Rating Calculator using PHP.  I created several websites using Drupal and/or raw HTML/CSS.

						At the height of my career I held the rank of 3 dan (European). I was the organizer of many local, national and international tournaments including the 2004 European Go Championship. I've held various roles in the Polish Go Association for more than a decade.
