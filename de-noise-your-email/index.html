                CCM is useful in a variety of contexts across different
                communication channels and one of the benefits of using it is
                that it helps to de-noise your communication. To get your point
                across faster and with fewer misunderstandings.
              </p>

              <p>
                Today we will look at how to
                <strong>de-noise your email</strong> with CCM.

              <h2>Start with a good title</h2>

              <p>
                Choose a title that pinpoints the topic of your email in a way
                that makes sense to the recipient
              </p>

              <p>
                Make it easy for people to answer the two main questions
                everyone keeps asking all the time:
              </p>

              <p>Why should I care?<br />What should I do?</p>

              <p>Be specific:</p>

              <p>
                Instead of &#8220;Problem&#8221; write
                <em>what kind of</em> problem or even better — what the impact
                is or was.
              </p>

              <p>
                Question or request? Consider putting it directly in the title.
              </p>

              <p>
                DO NOT reply to long email chains introducing new topics but
                keeping the old title
              </p>

              <p>
                DO NOT use overly clever or clickbait&#8217;y titles — be as
                direct as possible
              </p>

              <p>What about the length of the title?</p>

              <p>
                If the title is only a few words it might be too generic and
                thus likely to get lost in the sea of other generic titles. If
                the title is very long it will be hard to read. As a rule of
                thump I recommend aiming at 35-40 characters.
              </p>

              <p>
                Bonus points: Edit the names of attachments to make them
                appropriate in the recepient&#8217;s context. You might be
                sending them one &#8220;ideas.docx&#8221;, they might have other
                documents related to various kinds of ideas, so be specific:
                &#8220;Welo Feature Ideas from User Interviews in
                November.docx&#8221;.
              </p>

              <h2>Edit your email for content and structure</h2>

              <p>
                It&#8217;s tempting to just jot down whatever comes to mind and
                send, but to me maximally effective I recommend taking an extra
                minute or several to make your message better for your intended
                purpose and the likely needs and preferences of your recipients.
              </p>

              <h2>Make your email concrete</h2>

              <p>Refer to things you can both see or hear.</p>

              <p>Identify the key facts of the matter:</p>

              <p>The top three: Who? What? When?</p>

              <p>If you need more detail: Where? How? Why?</p>

              <p>Add links or screenshots where appropriate.</p>

              <p>
                If it&#8217;s a request — clearly state what you&#8217;re asking
                for.
              </p>

              <p>This one might be more subtle, but it helps a lot:</p>

              <p>
                Avoid unnecessary references – instead of writing &#8220;That
                document I sent her yesterday&#8221; consider making
                <s>it</s> your message more concrete &#8220;The document about X
                I sent to Y yesterday around Z titled T.&#8221;
              </p>

              <p>
                Even when you&#8217;re referring to something you wrote earlier
                in the same email unrolling the reference can help the reader a
                lot — they might be skipping around to find the parts most
                relevant to them and de-referencing instances of
                &#8220;that&#8221; places an unnecessary burden on
                <s>them</s> the reader.
              </p>

              <p>
                It might seem tedious at first, but it definitely helped me
                clarify my thinking and communicating and I&#8217;m sure it can
                help you too!
              </p>

              <h2>Make your email concise</h2>

              <p>Always start with the most important point.</p>

              <p>
                Structure for scanability — avoid sending a wall of text — use
                headings, bullet points and paragraph breaks — make it easy for
                readers to dig into the parts they care about and safely skip
                the parts they don&#8217;t.
              </p>

              <p>Highlight the ask, if there is one.</p>

              <p>
                Make your emails reasonably atomic — even if you have multiple
                topics to discuss with the same recipient, still consider
                sending separate emails per topic.
              </p>

              <p>
                Try to condense the relevant information into
                <a href="http://five.sentenc.es/?ref=localhost"
                  >five sentences or less</a
                >.
              </p>

              <p>
                Is your email more like a postcard or like a reference document?
                If it&#8217;s a reference consider putting the information
                somewhere where it is easy to refer to and refine later and
                linking to it from your email together with a short summary,
                rather than including the whole thing.
              </p>

              <h2>Make your email meaningful</h2>

              <p>
                Be clear with yourself about what you want or need from the
                other person and what that other person is likely to want or
                need.
              </p>

              <p>
                A good starting point is to assume that the recipient wants to
                quickly extract relevant information and avoid being confused or
                spending a long time untangling a
                <em>stream of consciousness</em> type text.
              </p>

              <p>
                The second level is to describe things using their language, and
                that includes the concepts not only the words.
              </p>

              <p>
                For example if you&#8217;re describing a technical problem
                technical terms are fine, but it&#8217;s also important to
                highlight why they should care — by describing the impact of the
                problem on their world (customers, revenue, timelines etc.) and
                what actions they could or should take.
              </p>

              <p>
                This one might require you to invest a little effort in
                understanding your recipients. When in doubt:
                <a
                  href="https://fluidcircle.net/2020/10/22/meaningful/?ref=localhost"
                  >Listen, Ask and Observe</a
                >.
              </p>

              <h2>What now?</h2>

              <p>
                All <s>this</s> the rules suggested above might seem like a lot.
                And it can be. But you don&#8217;t have to grok it all at once.
                Find the aspect of email that will give you the most benefit in
                your particular context and practice it, benefit, then select
                another, practice, benefit, maybe add your own rule, share it,
                practice, benefit, … rinse, repeat.
              </p>

              <p>
                If you&#8217;d be interested in more opportunities to practice
                and get real time feedback I&#8217;m considering organising an
