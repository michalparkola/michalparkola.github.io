                successful teams apart from others and psychological safety is
                number one on that list. We’re all reluctant to engage in
                behaviors that could negatively influence how others perceive
                our competence, awareness, and social standing. Although this
                kind of self-protection is a natural strategy in the workplace,
                it can be detrimental to effective teamwork. When team members
                feel psychologically safe, they are more willing to:

                <li>Ask questions</li>
                <li>Experiment with new ideas</li>

                <li>Take a risk while learning</li>
              </ol>

              <h2 id="viewer-dbc1r">What is psychological safety?</h2>

              <p id="viewer-89rb5">
                Amy Edmondson, professor at Harvard Business School, first
                identified the concept of psychological safety in work teams in
                1999. She defines it as a&nbsp;<strong
                  >shared belief that the team is safe for interpersonal
                  risk-taking</strong
                >. Team members feel psychological safety, when they believe
                they can be honest, sincere and feel accepted. They don’t need
                to pretend to be someone they are not, to avoid damage to their
                image, status or career.
              </p>

              <h2 id="viewer-ebv6">
                How does psychological safety influence the quality of teamwork?
              </h2>

              <p id="viewer-5l3lt">
                When we don’t feel safe, we hesitate to admit mistakes or share
                doubts and the quality of our work is threatened. Let&#8217;s
                take a look at Pixar, which is a company that knows how to use
                feedback and criticism in a psychologically safe way.
                Co-founder, Ed Catmull, says, that at the beginning all Pixar
                animations are extremely bad. They get better and better over
                time due to the continuous stream of constructive feedback. The
                end result is a movie widely appreciated by critics and
                audiences.
              </p>

              <h2 id="viewer-ao0du">
                Which factors most strongly influence psychological safety?
              </h2>

              <p id="viewer-cqt3v">
                Findings described in a 2009 research paper titled&nbsp;<em
                  >Learning Behaviours in the Workplace: The Role of
                  High-quality Interpersonal Relationships and Psychological
                  Safety</em
                >&nbsp;confirm that psychological safety is associated with
                high-quality relationships which are characterized by:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>high emotional carrying capacity,</li>
                <li>tensility,</li>
                <li>connectivity,</li>
                <li>positive regard,</li>
                <li>mutuality.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2 id="viewer-b22h">
                What exactly are those capacities and how can we use this
                knowledge in practice?
              </h2>

              <h3 id="viewer-dk19t">Emotional carrying capacity</h3>

              <p id="viewer-80jss">
                When a relationship has high&nbsp;<strong
                  >emotional carrying capacity</strong
                >, people can display a range of emotions and expect to be
                understood. This increases psychological safety, because people
                are less afraid to express negative emotions and therefore are
                more likely to speak up about emerging problems without fear of
                harmful reactions.
              </p>

              <p id="viewer-9o0o9">
                How can we&nbsp;<strong
                  >increase emotional carrying capacity</strong
                >&nbsp;while talking to our co-workers?
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>DO</strong>&nbsp;accept the emotions the other person
                  is feeling. For example you can say: “<em
                    >I understand, that you are dealing with some difficult
                    emotions right now…</em
                  >” or “<em>It seems that this situation has made you sad</em
                  >”.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>DON&#8217;T</strong>&nbsp;deny the other person’s
                  emotions. For example, if someone says: “<em>I am angry</em>.”
                  Don&#8217;t reply: “<em
                    >You don’t have a reason to feel angry in this situation</em
                  >!”. We all perceive and interpret reality in a subjective
                  way, so people can feel a whole different range of emotions.
                </li>
