                There&#8217;s a slight wrinkle hidden in the&nbsp;<a

                  when you&#8217;re stuck</a
                >.
              </p>

              <p>
                I told you to start by&nbsp;<strong
                  >clarifying the outcome</strong
                >&nbsp;by asking:
              </p>

              <ol>
                <li>What would you like to have happen?</li>
                <li>How will you&nbsp;know that it happened?</li>
                <li>Why is it important to you?</li>
              </ol>

              <p>
                and then to&nbsp;<strong
                  >clarify the next concrete action</strong
                >&nbsp;you will take to make it happen.
              </p>

              <p>I stand by that advice.</p>

              <p>But the wrinke is this:</p>

              <p>
                You might not be able to achieve the outcome with just this
                single action.
              </p>

              <p>More steps might be required.</p>

              <p>Sometimes many more.</p>

              <p>
                This is especially true for the outcomes you actually care about
                over the long run.
              </p>

              <p>
                And requiring many steps might not be the only problem. If
                you&#8217;re operating in a complex environment you might not
                know up front if the steps we have in mind will actually have
                the intended effect.
              </p>

              <p>That&#8217;s why I like to make the following distinction:</p>

              <p>
                A&nbsp;<strong>direct outcome</strong>&nbsp;is something you can
                control&nbsp;(with high-enough probability).&nbsp;It&#8217;s
                the&nbsp;<strong>concrete</strong>&nbsp;result of at most
                several work-sessions. It&#8217;s probably not the end of the
                story.
              </p>

              <p>
                An&nbsp;<strong>indirect outcome</strong>&nbsp;is something you
                care about and wish to influence, but is NOT within the reach of
                your direct actions.
              </p>

              <h2>
                <strong
                  >How to stay sane on the road to meaningful outcomes?</strong
                >
              </h2>

              <p>
                If you clarify your outcome and it looks like it might not be
                under your total control (i.e. it&#8217;s an indirect outcome)
                then&nbsp;<strong>start with a concrete step</strong>&nbsp;that
                you&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;under your control and
                then&nbsp;<em>iterate</em>&nbsp;towards the things you really
                want.
              </p>

              <p>
                1)&nbsp;<strong
                  >Clarify each step as it&#8217;s own direct outcome</strong
                >.
              </p>

              <p>
                Think of them as solid bricks that have their own separate
                existence but can also be stacked on top of each other to build
                a house.
              </p>

              <p>
                2) <strong>Set up some feedback loops</strong> and after laying
                the next brick ask yourself:
              </p>

              <ol>
                <li>How much closer am I to the goal?</li>
                <li>What have I learned in the process?&nbsp;</li>

                  work items)</strong
                >:
              </p>

              <p>
                1) Ask questions until you have a small number of&nbsp;<strong
                  >easy to check yes/no bullet points&nbsp;</strong
                >which are currently false and will become true when this item

                &#8220;acceptance criteria&#8221;.
              </p>

              <p>Useful questions to ask here:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>What kind of &#8230;?</li>
                <li>Is there anything else about &#8230;?</li>
                <li>How will we know this is done?</li>
                <li>What will we see or hear when this is done?</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                2) Make the title of the item a concrete and
                meaningful&nbsp;<strong>promise</strong>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Make the promise concrete-enough to be doable and
                meaningful-enough for someone to care. Even if it&#8217;s only
                you.
              </p>

              <p>If no one cares, don&#8217;t do it.</p>

              <p>Example:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Bad: &#8220;<em>One Minute Tip</em>&#8221; What about it?
                </li>
                <li>

                <li>
                  Even more concrete: &#8220;<em

              <p>
                Describe it in terms your stakholders understand and care about.
              </p>

              <p>Be brief.</p>

              <p>Useful questions to ask here:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>So what?</li>
                <li>Who cares?</li>
                <li>Why do they care?</li>
              </ul>

              <p>A more gentle way to probe at the purpose:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>And when (our direct outcome), what will happen then?</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                When following the chain of intended consequences, stop at the
                boundary of predictability (time) and reach (what you can
                control).
              </p>

              <p>
                Don&#8217;t get lost in the fog. When in doubt take some
                concrete steps and re-evaluate.
              </p>

              <p>Example:</p>

                  >&#8220;I intend to create&nbsp;a Digital Garden on my website
