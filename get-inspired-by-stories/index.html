              <p>
                To go far you need a large tank of high-octane fuel—or even
                better, a steady supply of&nbsp;<strong>renewable energy</strong
                >.
              </p>

              <p>
                You need to be able to tap into powerful drivers that actually
                move people to do things.
              </p>

              <p>
                And as a leader, you need to&nbsp;<strong
                  >start with yourself</strong
                >.
              </p>

              <p>Otherwise, you simply won’t get very far.</p>

              <p>
                For example, I always had money-related goals on my mind. Sadly
                they never moved me to do much of anything. The things that
                actually happened, I did for other reasons and money was a side
                effect. Important, but never the primary thing.
              </p>

              <p>
                To create a strong, motivating vision we must take into accounts
                three aspects:
              </p>

              <ol>
                <li>what&nbsp;<strong>you</strong>&nbsp;want,</li>
                <li>what&nbsp;<strong>other people</strong>&nbsp;want,</li>
                <li><strong>what might be possible together</strong>.</li>
              </ol>

              <p>
                Each can take many forms, but there is one thing that unifies
                all three. When you dig deeply into what moves people it&#8217;s
                likely you will find <em>stories</em>.
              </p>

              <h3>Get inspired by stories</h3>

              <p>
                When you look closely our goals do not typically appear out of
                the blue. They are often created by comparing our situation to a
                narrative about other people&#8217;s experience. As humans we
                have a strong
                <a href="https://perell.com/essay/peter-thiel/?ref=localhost"
                  >tendency to mimic each other</a
                >. And there is no better vehicle than a story to communicate
                important challenges and and behaviours of those who stand up to
                them.
              </p>

              <p>
                The idea for Grow Together Academy was also inspired by
                many&nbsp;<em>stories</em>.
              </p>

              <p>
                That includes stories from our own experience working with many
                teams and many leaders, stories from the best books we&#8217;ve
                read, stories from the best offline and online courses
                we&#8217;ve attended, and stories from the ones we&#8217;ve
                designed &amp; delivered ourselves.
              </p>

              <p>
                Stories from great books like&nbsp;<a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People?ref=localhost"
                  >7 Habits of Highly Effective People</a
                >,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.timetothink.com/?ref=localhost"
                  >Time to Think</a
                >, and&nbsp;<a
                  href="https://www.amazon.com/Contempt-Curiosity-Conditions-Collaborate-Modelling/dp/0957486618?ref=localhost"
                  >From Contempt to Curiosity</a
                >.
              </p>

              <p>
                Stories from movies and TV shows about how teams and leaders can
                behave at their best and worst, including: Star Trek, Dune, and
                Lord of the Rings.
              </p>

              <p>
                And most relevant for the type of experience we&#8217;re
                creating right now, there are the stories of several excellent
                online cohort-based courses that I attended, including&nbsp;<a
                  href="https://altmba.com/?ref=localhost"
                  >Seth Godin&#8217;s AltMBA</a
                >&nbsp;(I was part of cohort 33),&nbsp;<a

              </p>

              <p>It&#8217;s stories all the way down.</p>

              <p>
                But to make the best use of stories we need one more thing: we
                need to ground them in our own reality. To relate them to the
                things we see, hear and do in our immediate environment. But
                this is a topic for another time (and one which we will
                definitely dig into during Grow Together Academy).
              </p>

              <p>
                And what stories inspire YOU when it comes to leadership and
                collaboration? What epic heroes would you most like to be like?
                The vibe of which amazing teams would you love to replicate?
