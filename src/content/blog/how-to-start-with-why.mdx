*3 practical strategies*

Simon Sinek’s “Start with Why” is like a tsunami rolling over
the business world.

If you haven’t seen it yet or you’d like a reminder
here’s [Simon’s original TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp0HIF3SfI4&ref=localhost).

I used to be completely enamored with it 🤩

Over time I have become slightly more sceptical 🤔

I’ve also talked to many people who struggle with making it
practical 🏋️‍♀️

However I still believe in the core idea ❤️

And thanks to [many](https://twitter.com/judyrees?ref=localhost) [wonderful](https://twitter.com/asplake?ref=localhost) [teachers](https://twitter.com/imtomgilb?ref=localhost) I have accumulated some rather powerful techniques that
work towards the same purpose.

It’s actually the A in my [AsyncABC system](https://fluidcircle.net/asyncabc/?ref=localhost).

When planning anything significant: from a meeting, an article,
a product improvement or a whole new product …

… here are three (groups of) questions that can help you “start
with why” and tap into people’s deeper drives; without a
Sinek-style, singular, all encompassing mission.

The three questions are:

1. ***Whose life will be better** when we do
   this?*
2. ***What kind** of …?*and*Is there **anything else** about …?*
3. *And when …, what will we be able to **see or hear**?*

Let’s dig into each of them in turn:

—

**Question 1: Whose life will be better when we do
this?**

From the amazing Mike Burrows of [Agendashift](https://agendashift.com/?ref=localhost):

When starting anything, start by asking this set of closely
related questions:

> *Whose life will be better? How?*
>
> or *Who cares about this? Why?*
>
> or *Who will be affected? How?*
>
> and then *Do they actually want this?*
>
> if not: *What do they want?*

It might not be a single (type of) person, but a
whole **list of stakeholders**. That’s fine.
Focus on the critical few.

If you don’t find a convincing answer you might want to consider
doing something else instead.

**Question 2: What kind of X?** and **Is there anything else about X?**

One huge problem with planning in groups is that we frequently
imagine completely different things while using the exact same,
seemingly obvious, words.

There’s no such thing as obvious!

When someone tells you that they need X I encourage you to peel
back just one layer by repeating what they said and asking:

> *What kindof X?*

and when you explore one aspect you can go back to the beginning
and ask:

> *Is there anything else about X?*

I promise you you will frequently
be **surprised** by how differnt your
initial guess about what they meant was from what they actually
had in mind.

*Elephant? What kind of elephant?*

You might have recognized those questions as the [basics of clean language](https://reesmccann.com/2017/08/01/clean-language-about/?ref=localhost), which I encourage you to explore after you experience the
clarity that comes from just using those two easy to remember,
natural sounding, yet extremely powerful questions.

**Question 3: And when X, what will we be able to see or
hear?**

This is the most advanced purpose-clarification strategy of the
three we’re discussing today.

It becomes critical when there’s a lot riding on the exact
details of what we’re trying to achieve or when we’re spending a
lot of time talking about abstract concepts and are having a
hard time converging on specifics.

Take your list of stakeholders and the the things they care
about from section one.

About each need ask:

> *What will they be able to see and hear when we’re done?*

or more strongly

> *What will they be able to see and hear when we’re
> successful?*

Now comes the key part:

> *Express that as a number!*

In this part you might have recognized the influence of one Tom
Gilb. [Learn more about his approach to delivering stakeholder value
in the ValueFirst Manifesto](https://www.gilb.com/ValueFirst?ref=localhost).

**Bonus question: How do you know those needs are the real
needs?**

You don’t.

Start with your best guess and get fast feedback by asking for
it or better yet: observing how it impacts actual behaviors.

Once again:

1. ***Whose life will be better** when we do
   this?*
2. ***What kind** of …?*and*Is there **anything else** about …?*
3. *And when …, what will we be able to **see or hear**?*

Phew, a long one today, but a useful reference to have in one
piece I think.
