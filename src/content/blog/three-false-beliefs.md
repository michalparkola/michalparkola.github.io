The following are three harmful beliefs:

1. **What I see** is reality.
2. **What I think** is the truth.
3. **What I want** must be.

What *I believe is* more accurate:

1. **What I see** is a tiny subset of reality,
   heavily filtered by my imperfect senses.
2. **What I think** is a result of my experiences
   and influences going back to childhood.
3. **What I want** is just that â€“ what I want:
   * itâ€™s ok if I try and fail
   * itâ€™s ok if other people want other things (we may
     disagree or even fight, but the difference itself is
     neither strange or unnatural).

Do you agree?
