*Build up your team information environment*.

Today’s one minute tip is:

**use a consistent information architecture across
tools**.

For example: **given** you use JIRA
Stories as the main unit of work and you have a team
wiki, **when** you add information
supporting the development of a story to the
wiki, **then** this information should
clearly reference the story: directly in the title or in some
other clear and unambiguous way.

Or: **given** you distinguish several
types of information (say delivery plans, playbooks and
reference information)**when** you
create and share a Google Doc to brainstorm
ideas **then** you should clearly
indicate what the ideas are about: are they proposals for future
delivery plans? are they potential improvements to our playbooks
(i.e. operating standards and methods)? or are they optional
ideas that may be useful in some part of our work but do not
constitute a solid commitment?

All this might sound simple but there’s a deeper thought behind
it.

According to cognitive research:

> “*… the basic functioning mode of the human mind is not
> reasoning and planning,
> but **interacting** via perception
> and action with the environment*.” — [Francis Heylighen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Heylighen?ref=localhost) and [Clément Vidal](http://www.clemvidal.com/?ref=localhost), **[E](http://ecco.vub.ac.be/?ref=localhost)**[volution,](http://ecco.vub.ac.be/?ref=localhost)**[C](http://ecco.vub.ac.be/?ref=localhost)**[omplexity and](http://ecco.vub.ac.be/?ref=localhost)**[CO](http://ecco.vub.ac.be/?ref=localhost)**[gnition](http://ecco.vub.ac.be/?ref=localhost) group, [VUB](https://www.vub.be/?ref=localhost).

In order to go beyond simulating the office with your remote
team I encourage you to look at your work not just as individual
effort tied together by communication between people, but as
a **set of interactions with a distinct Team Information
Environment** made up of all the tools, services and technologies that
you use.![](https://i2.wp.com/cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd405c003-d12b-4eae-ad8f-60633447f4ef_1239x897.png?w=900&ssl=1)

Having a consistent information architecture across tools is one
way to improve that environment …

… but the rabbit hole goes much much deeper than that.

What do you say? Shall we jump in?
