When you have something to say, say it in a way that makes it
easy for people to understand you.

## **Lack of clarity causes problems**

If you leve things unclear or ambiguous some people might just
ignore the rest of you message.

Opportunity lost.

Or they will ask clarifying questions.

More work for you.

And if your communication lag is significant (e.g. communicating
across time-zones) the added delay might be costly too.

Or worst of all: they might act on their incorrect
understanding.

Get ready for problems later.

## **Make things clear, unambiguous and easy to digest**

1) Loyal readers of will be familiar with this: make your
communication CCM –
[Concrete](https://fluidcircle.net/2020/10/15/make-your-communication-concrete/?ref=localhost),
[Concise](https://fluidcircle.net/2020/10/20/make-your-communication-concise/?ref=localhost)
and
[Meaningful (to your intended audience)](https://fluidcircle.net/2020/10/22/meaningful/?ref=localhost).

2) Use simple words and grammatical structures:

* Instead of “indicate” write “show”
* Instead of “perform” write “do”
* Instead of “optimal” write “best”

[Test your writing using the Hemmingway app](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/?ref=localhost).   
(This article gets a “S*chool grade 4 level, good*” where a lower grade means easier to understand).

3) Write as if you were talking to your colleagues. As Kathy
Sierra put it “[Conversational writing kicks formal writing’s ass](https://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/09/conversational_.html?ref=localhost)“

4) Use headlings & lists to make things skimmable. Start
with the most important point. Make details available but not
required for people to get the main point. as appropriate. That
applies to the message as a whole as well as each part.

5) Make references concrete. If you’re talking about an
external resource
[link to it](https://fluidcircle.net/2020/09/02/show-dont-tell/?ref=localhost). Avoid context-dependent references like “they”,
“that”, “those”. ~~They~~ non-obvious
references are a common cause of misunderstandings and at best
require additional efort to untangle.

## Clear writing will save you time (and pain)

If you build a habit of writing clearly and make it easy for
people to understand:

* you will save time on clarifications,
* you will suffer fewer unpleasant surprises,
* and people will correctly assume your thinking is as clear as
  your writing.

What do you think? Is it worth some deliberate practice?
