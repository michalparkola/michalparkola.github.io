Sometimes there are decisions to be made in a team and sometimes
we don’t all agree on what to do. If the discussion is
dragging on it’s easy to just vote on it and move on.

For a high-performance team this is a mistake. If you want
everyone to remain fully commited to the success of the team
you cannot afford to trample objections like that.

The standard for teams should be
**soft consensus**:

1. The proposal passes only if there is no one clearly against
   it. Everyone is either supporting it or doesn’t care
   either way.
2. If there is even one person clearly against it we modify the
   proposal until that person can at least live with it.
   Otherwise the proposal is rejected.

If you care about your team don’t be impatient; work out a
soft consensus.

If you have deep, persistent disagreements you need to seriously
consider reforming your team rather than imagine that forcing
someone to accept a majority decision will not hurt that
persons commitment to the team.
