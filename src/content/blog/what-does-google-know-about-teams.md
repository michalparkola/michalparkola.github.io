*(This is a short note about something I found
useful in my role as a manager and coach at
[9LivesData](http://www.9livesdata.com/?ref=localhost).)*

Project Aristotle was a research project conducted by
Google. The goal of the project was to find what attributes of a
team contributed the most to it’s effectiveness.

The project found that the key factors of team
effectiveness are:

1. **Psychological safety**
2. **Dependability**
3. **Structure & clarity**
4. **Meaning of work**
5. **Impact of work**

  + “*Google’s intense data collection and number crunching
    have led it to the conclusions that [in] the best
    teams, members
    **listen to one another** and
    **show sensitivity to feelings and needs***“

  + psychological safety is needed if we have uncertainty
    and interdependence
  + frame the work as a learning problem, not an execution
    problem
