After [concrete](https://remoteleader.substack.com/p/good-communication-is-concrete?ref=localhost) and [concise](https://remoteleader.substack.com/p/make-your-communication-concise?ref=localhost), now is the time to cover the third part of the trilogy:
meaningful.

Talk about **what they care about**…

… using the **same words they use** to
describe it.

Great, but how do we know what people care about?

Here are three ways: Listen, Ask and Observe.

1) **Listen**

Many people love to talk, especially if they feel you’re
listening.

They will happily give you a lot of useful information.

Don’t interrupt them.

Pay high quality attention to what they’re saying (or writing).

Notice how they’re describing the situation (**what is**), the problem (**what they don’t want**) and the
desired outcome (**what they do want**).

Note the **exact words** they’re using.

**Take notes** and refer to them when you’re
preparing your own message.

2) **Ask**

You can also nudge your conversation partner to explore their
thinking more.

About the situation and the problem you can ask:

* “*What is that like?*”,
* “*What’s the most important thing about this?*”,
* “*And what happens then?*“

When they tell you about a problem, resist the urge to offer
solutions.

First turn the conversation towards desired outcomes by asking:

* “*And what would you like to have happen?*”

Listen and explore some more.

In this whole process don’t ask too many questions at once.

Ask one question and immediately switch back to high quality
listening.

Now you know a lot more about what people care about and you
have a much higher chance of making your own communication much
more meaningful.

To them.

3) **Observe**

Sometimes people are not ready to tell you their deepest
thoughts and desires.

Sometimes they might not be sure themselves.

The fallback solution it to also **observe what they actually do** in key situations.

That can often tell you a lot about what might be meaningful to
that person.

Update your assumptions accordingly.

That’s it.

1-2-3.

Listen-Ask-Observe.

Try for yourself and tell me your story!

See you soon,
