When explaining to laymen what a
requirement is (or more
importantly when telling a junior analyst what job is required
of them) some people say:

> “*Requirements specify the WHAT without going into the
> details of the HOW*.”

I’ve always found this explanation more confusing then
helpful. I mean is a statement like “*The customer enters a credit card number.*” a what or a
how?

Depending on where you stand it can be either!

For example:

1. making money is the what \*
   charging customers is the
   how
2. charging customers is the
   what \* accepting his
   credit card is the how
3. accepting a credit card is the
   what  \* getting it’s
   number is the how
4. getting the number is the
   what \* a text box on a web
   page is the how

This can go deeper still:

1. the textbox is the what \*
   the HTML tag is the how

The whole picture is made up of a hierarchy of levels each of
which is a what for the
level bellow and a how for
the level above.

Saying “*You should write more about the what then about the how*.” is really meaningless. What you should say is
something like: “*Concentrate on
user’s goals without
going into the specifics of
how those goals are
achieved in the actual user interface but instead looking into
how they help achieve his
overall objectives.*”

So please: be specific! And
don’t confuse newbies: we tend to have a hard time as it
is ;-)
