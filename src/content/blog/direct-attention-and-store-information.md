Use email or chat toÂ **direct attention**,  
use
a team wiki toÂ **store information**.

Email and chat usually carry a high-level of urgency, but make
it pretty hard to refer to key pieces of information later. This
makes it that much harder to develop useful knowledge over time.

Systems like aÂ [Wiki](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/qduzpo3l03a7hw8634fl/dpheh0hqozzvm7sm/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXRsYXNzaWFuLmNvbS9zb2Z0d2FyZS9jb25mbHVlbmNl?ref=localhost)Â orÂ [internal Blogs](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/qduzpo3l03a7hw8634fl/e0hph7hkl9962ki8/aHR0cHM6Ly93b3JkcHJlc3MuY29tL3AyLw==?ref=localhost)Â are much better forÂ **storing information**Â and
enabling knowledge to grow over time. It does take
someÂ *librarianship*, but in my experience it can be well
worth it.

One key factor is making it easy to capture information
intoÂ *packages*Â that areÂ *individually addressable.*

This makes it easy toÂ *curate*Â tham â€“ to make
connections, collect related packages and combine them into new,
higher-level ideas.â€‹

So use semi-ephemeral channels like email and chat to direct
attention and tools with a better information architecture to
store information.
