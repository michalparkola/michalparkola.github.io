Autumn was a busy time for me and my girlfriend.

We‚Äôve moved from a single room micro-appartment to one
more conducive to two people working from home all the time.
We‚Äôve also adopted a cat. Both of those things contributed
to our sense of calmness and satisfaction.

On the other hand we‚Äôve both been swamped with work. I
don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever done as much in the same
amount of time as I did in the last 3 months. And my gf is not
on vacation either.

All that has led us to come up with the following
**three things to take care of in order not to go crazy**
in this special time:

1. Limits
2. Regeneration
3. Meaning

## Limits

There is always more to do.

Backlogs are usually infinite.

TODO lists have hydra-like tendencies: check off one item and
two more pop up in it‚Äôs place.

There is always just one more thing to read, one more task to
get done, one more event to attend, etc.

Without healthy limits this leads straight to burnout.

Here are three ideas to try:

Every day select up to
**three most important tasks** and schedule them
first. If you attack your tasks in order of importance you will
a) feel more satisfied when you inevitably have to cut off your
todo list b) you will generate more actual value and everyone
will be happier even if you drop some of the lower-value items.
See
[here](https://produktywni.pl/en/?ref=localhost) or
[here](https://jdmeier.com/agile-results-on-a-page/?ref=localhost)
for more about this.

Do not let work spread it‚Äôs tentacles throughout your
whole life. Have a defined end time. Have a separate work-space.
Consider a transition routine to underline when you‚Äôre
working and when you‚Äôre NOT working. For example my friend
[Lisette](http://collaborationsuperpowers.com/?ref=localhost)
has a husband-negotiated window of hours she is allowed to work
in.
[SoftwareMillers](http://softwaremill.com/?ref=localhost)
has a habit of ‚Äúsigning off‚Äù on Slack to indicate
the end of their work day.

This works in the other direction too. If you‚Äôre working,
work. Negotiate with your family that despite being physically
at home you‚Äôre not available for non-emergencies during
work hours.

Make time for breaks during the day ‚Äì schedule meetings to end a
few minutes earlier, use the pomodoro technique, listen to your
smartwatch and stand up at least every hour or so, schedule your
lunch break. Don‚Äôt wake up with a wall of back-to-back
meetings all day, every day.

If this is a pain point for you might want to check out the
[Meeting Overload Rescue Kit](http://pages.fluidcircle.net/mork?ref=localhost). Let me know if you want to chat about how to apply it with
your team.

## Regeneration

Make sure you‚Äôre getting
[enough high-quality **sleep**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cteidxwSPSE&ref=localhost), you‚Äôre
[**eating** well](http://nutritionfacts.org/?ref=localhost)
and **drinking** enough water. Forgive the graphic
example, but your pee should be light yellow ‚Äì if it‚Äôs
dark in color you are dehydrated.

**Exercise** regularly ‚Äì it‚Äôs not just about
building muscle ‚Äì exercise has a strong influence on health,
mood and cognitive ability. Personally when I don‚Äôt work
out for a week I get visibly depressed.

An hour-long brisk walk every day is a good base.

If you want more online training is a thing ‚Äì not even counting
the

of

[follow-along workouts](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCciuZl2ydLCvN5txlLW0rIg?ref=localhost)
on youtube there are many

to motivate you and even
[online personal training](https://www.facebook.com/fitpasterz).

**Naps** also help :)

During breaks take care to **unwind** a bit and to
activate your para-sympathetic nervous system:

1. **Breathe** deeply ‚Äì I like box breathing which
   goes like this ‚Äì breathe in for 4 seconds, hold full for 4
   seconds, breathe out for 4 seconds, hold empty for 4 seconds,
   repeat.
2. **Relax** and **ground** yourself ‚Äì
   stand or sit with feet firmly fixed on the ground, turn hands
   palms up, relax your jaw and your whole face.
3. Look at something far away and something
   **green** ‚Äì ever since high school I loved
   looking at trees swaying softly in the wind, just outside the
   upper floor window. I also like to listen to sounds of nature
   from an app called Noisly. Walks in a real park are great, if
   possible.

## Meaning

This ia a powerful, yet much less obvious one.

This can be hard if you‚Äôre not used to it, but for me it
made a massive difference when I managed to reframe things form
**I-have-to** to **I-want-to**.

There is no such thing as ‚Äúmust‚Äù.

Even with a gun to my head I have a choice. It might be an
obvious choice but it‚Äôs still a choice. And usually the
consequences for non-compliance are not as dire as that.

Even if you end up doing the exact same things the element of
personal choice can make it much easier.

It might not be appropriate with other people, but internally,
when I hear or think ‚Äúmust‚Äù, I like to ask myself
‚Äúorrrr what?‚Äù

This forces me to have a clear sense of the purpose and, when
found, this purpose gives me basically unlimited amounts of
energy. And when I lose this sense even simple obstacles can
seem insurmountable.

And that‚Äôs it for today. If you‚Äôre under a lot of
pressure try introducing limits, adding regeneration and finding
some meaning.

It helped us a lot and I believe it can help you too.
