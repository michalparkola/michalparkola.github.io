Have you ever said or done something you regret while angry?

Have you ever tried to reason with a person overcome by strong
emotions?

Yup, so did I.

Itâ€™s a useful skill to be able to**recognize emotional states in yourself and others**
and apply countermeasures before itâ€™s too late.

It might also be valuable to
**share this model with your team** so that you can
notice situation when some preparation is needed before a
high-quality discussion can happen.

An extremely simplified, but useful model is the traffic lights
model:
**RED**,
**AMBER**
and
**GREEN**.

## **RED**

**RED**
means strong emotions, usually with high-energy, caused by some
kind of perceived threat.

Your teammate messed up a bunch of your hard work. Someone stole
your new bike. You got blamed for something that
*obviously* wasnâ€™t your fault and youâ€™re
angry and maybe a little afraid.

The problem is that in our modern environment this perceived
threat usually does not require an immediate reaction, and might
not be real threat at all. Acting quickly in such a state, or
trying to have a logical discussion with someone else in a
**RED**
state is usually a mistake.

When youâ€™re in the
**RED**
zone â€” pause, take a deep breath and consider what it is that
youâ€™re actually trying to achieve here.

For example if you want to continue having a good relationship
with someone itâ€™s probably not useful to scream at them
when they do something you donâ€™t like. If you can try to
defer the situation until you are both in a calmer state.
Turning the tension into a joke might also help!

## **AMBER**

**AMBER**
means youâ€™re unsure about the situation you are in â€” most
importantly the kind and quality of relationship you have with
the people around you.

A teammate made a joke and youâ€™re not sure if
theyâ€™re laughing with you or at you. Your boss made a
frowny face when looking at your most recent report and
youâ€™re starting to thinking they might secretly hate your
guts.

**AMBER**
could also be caused by physical discomfort â€” being hungry, cold
or sleep-deprived.

An
**AMBER**
state is usually lower energy compared to RED and might manifest
as passivity or harshness without starting a full-blown fight.
**AMBER**
is still not conducive to creative problem solving. Itâ€™s a
state of compromised performance.

When you or the other person is in
**AMBER**
the first order of priority is to satisfy basic needs of the
body (eat, drink, rest) and ensure a physical and psychological
sense of safety.

Sometimes repeating that despite the problem youâ€™re facing
you still value the other person and want to look for solutions
together is enough to bring someone out of
**AMBER**
and into green.

## **GREEN**

**GREEN**
is the state when there are no obstacles to creative problem
solving, joyful socializing or having deep conversations. When
you and your conversation partner are in a
**GREEN**
state youâ€™re good to go.
