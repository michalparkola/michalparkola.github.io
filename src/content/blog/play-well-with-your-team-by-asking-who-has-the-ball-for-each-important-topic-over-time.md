## The Problem

Sometimes there is more than one person who could do something.
How do we
**avoid stepping on each other's toes** or even
worse – **leaving the problem unsolved** because
everyone thinks it's someone else's job?

Some examples:

* An email arrives from a client: *Who should answer?*
* The client makes a request on Slack:
  *Who will respond?*
* We're preparing for a meeting:
  *Who will take the lead?*
* The Product Owner is going on vacation:
  *Who will make a product decision?*
* The Tech Lead is sick and there's an important architectural
  decision to be made: *Who should make it?*

In most teams we have various processes and
tools to help us. We have roles and
responsibilities.

But that is not always enough, is it.

What if the usual person is not available? What if it's a
cross-team collaboration? What if one person is currently
overloaded? What if someone wants to learn?

What if … what if … what if …

Real life is more complex than predefined rules can completely
regulate.

## The Solution

Here's one thing that helps.

As the Python community figured out:
[explicit is better than implicit](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/?ref=localhost).

So in situations where it's not 100% clear (and in some
situations where *you think* it is):

> **Ask** the other people who are involved:
> **Who has the ⚽️?**

The one with the ball is not the king of the universe. They
might also not be the captain of that particular team.

But they're running with the ball right now. They decide which
direction to take and where to kick it next.

Asking this question will help you and your team reduce the
chance of stepping on each other's toes or ignoring an important
issue.
