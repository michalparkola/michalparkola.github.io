*Meeting minutes are where great ideas are left to die*

One question:

How often do you go back to old **meeting notes**?

Yeah,

… me neither.

As I do more and more remote work one key discipline has become
to **work out loud**and **leave tracks**. To capture important information as I go.

But that can create it’s own set of problems.

That’s why **managing the flow of information** is one of the three key skills of remote work.

Especially the **async** kind of remote
work.

One key idea is to **libreate ideas from their shells**.

As an example: I recently switched my note taking method from
organizing notes around the source (e.g. book, youtube talk or
podcast) towards giving each idea it’s own note. So if I listen
to a podcast I might have 3-5 separate notes from it. It works
wonders for my learning.

Ok, back to work.

If a great idea starts life in a meeting it might find it’s way
to the aforementioned meeting notes. But for it to have room to
grow it needs to be liberated from there.

1. For a great idea to grow we need to be able to **link to it directly**. It needs to be **individually addressable**.
2. For a great idea to grow we need to be able to put it in
   various **collections of related ideas**,
   ideas to follow-up on, etc.
3. For a great idea to grow we need to be able to use it as
   a **building block for higher-level ideas**.

[Side note: That’s why the C in](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1967cfd3-f354-469f-948b-2048426b01d0_898x504.png?ref=localhost)[AsyncABC](http://fluidcircle.net/asyncABC/?ref=localhost) is “*Connect Everything*”

**What’s in it for you?**

How many of your ideas died because they didn’t have what they
needed to grow?

Which of your current ideas can you liberate from their shells?

TODO: Create just a bit more space for a great idea. Capture it
in a tangible form. Put it somewhere where you can easily link
to it. Add it to a collaction in which it’s most likely to be
picked up. Then build on top of it.

Do it now!
