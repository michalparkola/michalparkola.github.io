*Base key decision on estimated impact on quantified
stakeholder values*

Will your project succeed?

That question hangs on a simple commandment:

> Make things people want.

Great, but how do we know what people want?

This is definitely a difficult question,

but there’s a powerful technique that can help cut through
ambiguity.

It is to ***quantify*****the top 10 most important things** for your project or product.

Express them as a number.

Clarify **with your most important stakeholders** that it’s actually what they had in mind.

And then **estimate the impact of the options** you’re considering on those values.

I promise you it will bring to the surface misunderstandings
that might otherwise derail your whole initiative.

Do this:

1. Bring your
key **stakeholders** together.

2. Ask what they **value** most: what is
most important for them.

Try to express it as a concrete number,

what will you actually be able to **see or hear** when you’re successful?

How much of that?

Got the list?

Great.

Now:

3. List your **options**: the projects or
strategies you were considering.

4. Using your *collective best guess*: how big of
an **impact** will that project or
strategy have on each of the most important stakeholder values?

At what *cost*?

Of course you will not be sure at this point.

Don’t worry, we’ll validate the assumptions later.

But some strategies will *obviously* not be
reasonable.

Drop those.

Focus on the most promising ones.

Iterate in short cycles.

Try it and let me know how it goes for you!
