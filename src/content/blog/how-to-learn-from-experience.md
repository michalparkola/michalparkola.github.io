**This post* is a sneak peek at an idea from*the upcoming book "[Grow Together: Gain Clarity and Momentum in Your Tech
Leadership Career](http://growtogether.academy/book?ref=localhost)"**

At various points in the lifecycle of our projects we like to
ask about the **lessons** we have
**learned** from that project.

But not all LLs are created equal.

For example raw observations or opinions like "*I should have paid more attention to X*" are a fine starting point but they are unlikely to make a
tangible difference on their own.

So what makes a *good* lesson and how do me make ours
*better*?

The must-ask question then becomes: Good
*for what purpose*?

My answer:

The purpose of a successful lesson learned is to
**do something differently** such that we get
**better** (*expected*)**results**.

Which means to me that:

* If there's no change in action then the lesson has not been
  learned.
* If the new action does not lead to better (*expected*)
  results then it was the wrong lesson.

So at minimum a good lesson learned should describe in concrete
terms:

1. **a change in behavior** (*who* should do
   *what*, *when* and *how*)
2. **the desired result** (preferably something we
   can *see* or *hear*)

More information that can be useful:

1. In what **context** or under what assumptions
   does this lesson apply?
2. What is the **key moment** when we should perform
   this action? How do we know it is that moment?
3. Compared to what? What **mistake** is likely to
   lead to what undesired result?
4. What was the actual **story** that led to this
   lesson? What happened? What did we do and how did we do it?
   What happened then?

What are you going to learn from your recent experience?
