One of the [key skills of remote work](https://fluidcircle.net/keyskills/?ref=localhost) is to **communicate well (in short chunks (of writing))**.

Let me explain:

**Communicate well**

What counts as *communicating well* depends on
the purpose:

1. if it’s information — is it easy to understand and relevant to
   what the audience cares about?
2. if the purpose is influence — does it move people to action?
3. if it’s a question — is easy to answer with the right
   information?

**In short chunks**

Long-form communication is useful, but for effective remote work
we must especially master communicating in short chunks.

It’s not only meaty articles, exhustive technical manuals or
detailed presentations.

It’s a bunch of short snippets that contains the lifeblood of
our daily interactions towards getting things done:

1. clear and actionable e-mails,
2. chat messages that are easy to understand and respond to,
3. informative comments on work items,
4. as well as spoken statements during face to face
   conversations.

**Of writing**

Meetings are still important, 1on1 video conversations do play a
crucial role, recorded explanations are now super easy to record
thanks to services like Loom.

But the bread and butter of remote communication is, and should
be, written.

Prefereably **captured** in a transparent
and reliable **repository** like Trello
or a Wiki not a semi-ephemeral form like chat or email.

**Ok, but how?**

I like to think about making my communication CCM:

Concrete, Concise and Meaningful.

More concrete tips on how to do that are coming in the next
several One Minute Tips, but for now:

How good is the communication you receive in your daily work?

Is it CCM?

How good is the communication you typically send (or speak)?

What might you be able to do if your communication skills
improved significantly?

See you soon!
