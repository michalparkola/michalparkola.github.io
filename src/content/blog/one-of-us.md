How do you create a shared identity for a distributed team,
without the benefit of physical proximity?

Here are some things that I believe are most important:

# 1) Spend time in shared spaces

Even if you sit in a physical office real work is slowly (or
sometimes quickly) migrating to online places like Slack, Zoom,
Trello, Wiki or a
[full-blown Virtual Space](http://welo.space/?ref=localhost).

Lurking there is not enough. For team cohesion to develop
it’s important to see and be seen:

1. For **video**-interactions on calls or Looms make
   sure to have good **framing** (more or less eye
   level, with your head and shoulders filling the screen) and
   **light** (on your face, not from behind you
   — you’re not in witness protection yet) as well as
   clear **audio**.
2. **Use your actual face as your avatar** across
   all communication channels (Slack, Trello/Jira, your virtual
   office). Avoid abstract avatars. You are not a Monopoly piece
   or a Minion.
3. And last but not least:
   **make meaningful contributions to online discussions**
   in Slack, comments on tickets, shared docs, etc. Don’t
   wait for your final deliverable to be ready — package
   intermediate steps as building blocks — build on other
   people’s blocks and let them build on yours. (this is
   the “B” in the
   [AsyncABC approach to distributed work](https://fluidcircle.net/notes/asyncabc/?ref=localhost)).

# 2) Rally around a shared purpose

As a leader you need to communicate and
**overcommunicate the vision and values** for your
team. Do it
**until you hear people echo it back to you**, and
after that too.

Make it clear and make it visible:

1. verbally and in writing while discussing all kinds of ongoing
   work,
2. on your website, in your specs, in your playbooks,
3. in 1on1 discussions and group workshops
4. with vision boards, OKRs, dashboards/scorecards,
5. or whatever other way that is appropriate for your situation.

# 3) Make history, together

Before you become a billion-dollar company and end up on the Joe
Rogan Experience there are simple ways you can accumulate a
shared history.

You will look back on it fondly, you will appreciate how far
you’ve come and your junior colleagues will be able to
engage more deeply with what your team went through to get to
where you are.

You don’t have to put a massive effort into it either —
it’s enough to set up the right tools and from time to
time capture things that happen anyway — screenshots from your
MVP, pics from an initial meeting with your first customer,
articles written about your product in a major outlet, people
joining or leaving the team.

As a minimum I recommend the following two artifacts:

1. An official **team roster** with meaningful
   information about each team member – team affiliation
   (if you have a multi-team org), role, when they joined,
   location, timezone (bonus points for displaying the local time
   there now), project credits, kudos from other team members,
   etc.
2. An **internal blog** (and/or dedicated Slack
   channel or a special Trello board) with posts celebrating
   milestones, short video-updates, stories with pictures of
   real-world team meetings if and when they happen, etc.

If I ever visit your team I’d love to see your history
laid out clearly for people to enjoy and benefit from.
