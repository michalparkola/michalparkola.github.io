Where does teamwork happen?

For many teams it‚Äôs in meetings*.*

Sure, everyone might have tasks to work through on their own,
but in many teams the key interactions happen in meetings and
conversations.

There‚Äôs nothing wrong with that IF it works well for your
team.

But it doesn‚Äôt always.‚Äã

A strong¬†**everything-is-a-meeting habit**¬†may lead to:

* people wasting time,
* people being nailed to their workstations without much
  flexibility to adjust their schedule,
* frequent unpleasant surprises, when a lot of what‚Äôs
  discussed is quickly forgotten.

On top of that remote work is a whole¬†**new medium**.

Remote work is fundamentally different than office work and we
should take advantage of that.

One important idea in this new world is¬†**async**.

Enabling asynchronous work is a big opportunity to improve the
way your team communicates and collaborates.

Being able to work more asynchronously can improve:

* **depth**¬†of focus which leads to higher quality
  thinking,
* **flexibility**¬†to work whenever is best for you,
* **durability**¬†of work-products including
  supporting artifacts like working notes, outlines and
  sketches.

The main challenge of async is keeping individual work well
connected. To make our work available for others to use. To
enable everyone to meaningfully help each other. To ultimately
tie it all to our common goal.

Async is not about a meeting prohibition. We still want to be
able to talk to each other in smaller and yes, sometimes bigger
groups. The main idea is to keep the right balance.

Inspired by the¬†[Nozbe communication pyramid](https://nozbe.com/blog/communication-pyramid/?ref=localhost)¬†here‚Äôs a simple model that can help you figure out the
right balance for your team:

![](/images/pyramid-of-healthy-comm.jpg)

1) The foundation of this pyramid is individual
**focused work**.

2) When we‚Äôre done with a focused work session we should be able
to capture and package the results of that work. It could a
shared document, a comment on an internal blog or your favorite
ticketing system. The main goal is to allow others to
**give thoughtful feedback** and also to use your
work in their own efforts.

3) When we want to go back and forth quickly we can have
conversations in chat or voice.

4) And when we need to connect more people at the same time we
run a meeting. But since we‚Äôve focused on the other layers of
the pyramid first those are fewer and more deliberately
optimized for a specific purpose.

That is the pyramid of healthy communication based on focused
work.

And how is it for you?

What kinds of communication dominate on your team? How well is
that balance working for you?

See you soon, Micha≈Ç
