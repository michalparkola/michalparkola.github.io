# The Challenge

I believe that in order to create a better world for everyone we
need to become better at working together and in order to unlock
our collective potential we need radically better ways to learn.

With that in mind the Learning Paths System is a new way to
structure learning programs.

# Why is learning important?

1. The short tarm goal is to gain a useful skill to solve a
   specific problem.
2. The long term goal is to become a better person (a better
   spouse and parent, a more sought after professional, etc.).
3. The end goal is to make the world a better place for everyone
   (that is increase the total, average and minimum quality of
   life).

# A new operating system for learning

The primary purpose of the Learning Paths System is to help
Teachers help Learners acquire the Skills they need to succeed
at whatever it is they want to succeed at.

The Learning Paths System aims to provide better answers to two
key questions:

1. What is worth learning?
2. How to learn it?

One of the ways the LPS aims to achieve this is through a highly
structured and granular approach that enables radical
adaptability and continous, data-driven improvement of all
elements.

Using the Learning Paths System can help Teachers multiply their
impact while keeping the essential human element at the center
of the experience.

# Basic building blocks of Learning Paths

These are the key concepts that lie at the heart of the Learning
Paths system:

* **Skill** (or Capability) = an ability to repeatably
  achieve a well defined goal
* **Observable Competence Criteria** = an unambiguous test of
  a Skill.
* **Learning Activity** or **Challenge** = something you
  do to gain, demonstrate or reinforce a skill (or several
  related skills).
* **Learning Path** = a set of related activities that go
  naturally together (walked by previous learners, paved/marked
  by guides).
* **Learning Map** = the sum of all skills and stories in a
  certain area.
* **Learning Journey** = the set of skills, activities and
  challenges selected and completed by a particular person
  throughout their learning experience.
* **Teacher** = a coach, mentor, teacher, sempai or anyone
  who has walked the paths in a certain area and can guide new
  learners through them.
* **Learner** = the learner walking a new path using the map
  to orient self, with or without the help of a guide. Everyone
  can be a learner regardless of their skill level.

# How will Learning Paths work?

The first step is for a Teacher to sketch out a Learning Map of
the area they want to teach.

When the Student is ready to learn she will choose a starting
point based on her goals, context and preferences.

As the Student works through Learning Activities and Challenges
she can “choose her own adventure” by skipping
unintereating branches and digging deeper into the areas that
are most relevant to the Student.

The Student builds a solid foundnation for future success by
unambiguously demonstrating her new Skills (meeting Observable
Mastery Criteria) as to avoid a false sense of achievement if
real learning did not occur.

As the Student masters the fundamentals she can graduate to more
advanced programs and once she reaches the frontiers of well
worn paths she can venture out with a confidence of a solid
foundation to return to once in a while.

At any point the Student can help guide less advanced learners
through completed Challenges and once confident enough the
Student can build their own Learning Paths in a different area
or create an alternative way to guide future learners through
the same area.

All the while the Learning Paths System observes each new
learner progressing through each program and helps the course
creator improve it. The structure and granularity of the model
increases the “resolution” of those observation and
will allow insights unavailable in a traditional approach.
