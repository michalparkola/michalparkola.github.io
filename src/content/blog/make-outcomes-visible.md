Kanban people remind us to **visualize work**.

The default example is a board full of cards that represent
tasks and their status.

Something like this:

That is a powerful tactic and we will surely explore it in
future posts.

But now I want to start with something a little different:

**Visualize the outcomes your work is intended to
deliver**, not just the work itself.

Both direct and indirect outcomes.

**Direct outcomes** are the immediate results
of your actions: for example the code you’ve written or
the blog posts you’ve published.

Please note, it will be important soon: there’s minimal
uncertainty about the action => outcome connection.

Direct outcomes are one thing, but it’s the **indirect outcomes** that are what *really* counts.

Most people care less about the code you’ve written and
more about the app it is running,

less about the raw text of your posts and more about the things
they can learn from them.

The gold is burried in the **human needs waiting to be served by the (indirect) ourcomes
of your work**.

The only problem is that the connection between action and
indirect outcomes is, well… *indirect*.

To achieve the really important indirect outcomes you
need **sustained action over time**

… and some **feedback loops** to
correct course on your way.

It can be hard, but if you **consistently keep your eyes on what matters most** you are bound to achieve amazing results.

Go forth and visualize!
