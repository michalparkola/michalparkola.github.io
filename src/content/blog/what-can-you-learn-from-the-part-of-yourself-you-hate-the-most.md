According to Carl Jung each one of us carries a shadow.

The shadow is a part of us we hate the most. The weaknesses and
tendencies we are desperate to suppress. The parts we will do
anything to hide from people.

I learned about the the concept in June 2020 when I attended
John Scherer's Leadership Development Intensive program.

The most intense part of the program was exploring our shadows.
We did it by choosing a pop culture figure that most closely
resembled what we would least like to be.

Mine was Hanibal Lecter 🤫🐑

But then came the most surprising part came right after:

We were asked to learn from our shadow 😱

To consider if maybe by avoiding the most hated traits we were
also avoiding things that could serve us well.

To take a small part of the shadow and learn from it without
becoming it (it's a shadow for a reason, after all).

If you're up for the challenge ask yourself:

What would I most hate to hear people saying about me behind my
back?

and then

What part of that can I learn from, without going too far?
