**What holds a great team together despite inevitable
conflict?**

[John Gottman](https://www.gottman.com/about/?ref=localhost)¬†has some answers. John has been studying married couples
for decades. Work relationships are not marriages but the same
concepts can be incredibly useful to leaders of high-performance
teams.

One of the highlights of John‚Äôs work, that resonated with me
when I first read it and continues to resurface for me often, is
the concept of¬†[The Magic Ratio](https://www.gottman.com/blog/the-magic-relationship-ratio-according-science/?ref=localhost)¬†which states:

> for every negative interaction during conflict, a stable and
> happy relationship has five (or more) positive interactions

**How is that relevant?**

First of all, by taking care to load up our¬†*emotional bank accounts*¬†we can create a sense of psychological safety and trust
that makes it much easier to de-escalate and look for solutions
when conflicts occur.

Second of all, people‚Äôs brains are wired to react more strongly
to threats than to rewards, so even a ‚Äúbalanced‚Äù 1:1 situation
is not enough for safe & satisfying collaboration.

[And on top of that,](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F171c60cf-5ddc-42fb-9be5-f84025a0dd9d_1336x909.jpeg?ref=localhost)[as mentioned in the previous installment](https://remoteleader.substack.com/p/identify-the-good-before-looking?ref=localhost), amplifying the good parts tends to work better than fixating
on problems, weaknesses and deficiencies.

**How can we add positive interactions?**

1. express honest & meaningful appreciation
2. listen respectfuly & attentively
3. keep a promise or renegotiate early when you can‚Äôt
4. do things together
5. highlight things you agree with
6. make work more meaningful by connecting it to the bigger
   picture

What is the current ratio on your team?

What can you going to nudge it in the right direction?
