*(This is a short note about something I found
useful in my role as a manager and coach at
[9LivesData](http://www.9livesdata.com/?ref=localhost).)*

Notes:

* teams are much better than individuals at solving complex
  tasks
* individual or maximal intelligence of group
  members matters less than collective intelligence and
  there is no correlation between individual and collective
  intelligence
* social perceptiveness and evenness of communication
  drives collective intelligence
* empathy earns money: more empathy ~> better collective
  intelligence ~> better business outcomes
