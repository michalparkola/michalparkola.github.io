**Have you ever experienced that another co-worker didn’t want
to listen to your feedback, even though it would clearly
improve their performance? Did an important project fail
because an employee didn’t tell you about unresolved issues
with a client? Perhaps it is a lack of psychological safety
that hampers open communication with your team.**

[Research at Google](https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/?ref=localhost) showed that there are five key dynamics that set
successful teams apart from others and psychological safety is
number one on that list. We’re all reluctant to engage in
behaviors that could negatively influence how others perceive
our competence, awareness, and social standing. Although this
kind of self-protection is a natural strategy in the workplace,
it can be detrimental to effective teamwork. When team members
feel psychologically safe, they are more willing to:

1. Ask questions
2. Experiment with new ideas
3. Make mistakes
4. Give an opinion
5. Take a risk while learning

## What is psychological safety?

Amy Edmondson, professor at Harvard Business School, first
identified the concept of psychological safety in work teams in
1999. She defines it as a **shared belief that the team is safe for interpersonal
risk-taking**. Team members feel psychological safety, when they believe
they can be honest, sincere and feel accepted. They don’t need
to pretend to be someone they are not, to avoid damage to their
image, status or career.

## How does psychological safety influence the quality of teamwork?

When we don’t feel safe, we hesitate to admit mistakes or share
doubts and the quality of our work is threatened. Let’s
take a look at Pixar, which is a company that knows how to use
feedback and criticism in a psychologically safe way.
Co-founder, Ed Catmull, says, that at the beginning all Pixar
animations are extremely bad. They get better and better over
time due to the continuous stream of constructive feedback. The
end result is a movie widely appreciated by critics and
audiences.

## Which factors most strongly influence psychological safety?

Findings described in a 2009 research paper titled *Learning Behaviours in the Workplace: The Role of
High-quality Interpersonal Relationships and Psychological
Safety* confirm that psychological safety is associated with
high-quality relationships which are characterized by:

* high emotional carrying capacity,
* tensility,
* connectivity,
* positive regard,
* mutuality.

## What exactly are those capacities and how can we use this knowledge in practice?

### Emotional carrying capacity

When a relationship has high **emotional carrying capacity**, people can display a range of emotions and expect to be
understood. This increases psychological safety, because people
are less afraid to express negative emotions and therefore are
more likely to speak up about emerging problems without fear of
harmful reactions.

How can we **increase emotional carrying capacity** while talking to our co-workers?

* **DO** accept the emotions the other person
  is feeling. For example you can say: “*I understand, that you are dealing with some difficult
  emotions right now…*” or “*It seems that this situation has made you sad*”.
* **DON’T** deny the other person’s
  emotions. For example, if someone says: “*I am angry*.”
  Don’t reply: “*You don’t have a reason to feel angry in this situation*!”. We all perceive and interpret reality in a subjective
  way, so people can feel a whole different range of emotions.
* **DO** create a safe space for people to
  share their emotions. It is easier to deal with them, once you
  talk about them in an honest and safe way.
* **DO** find safe opportunities to share your
  own emotions.

### Tensility

**Tensility** allows the relationship to bend
and withstand stress and conflict and bounce back after
setbacks. Due to this capacity of high-quality relationships,
psychological safety is reinforced and people tend to talk more
freely and openly.

How can
we **enhance** **tensility** while
talking to our co-workers?

* **DON’T** jump to conclusions if you
  hear something that makes you feel anxious or
  angry **DO** ask questions to clarify
  what the other person really meant.
* **DO**paraphrase what the other person said
  to let them know you’re really listening and to make
  sure you understood them correctly.
* **DO**accept healthy disagreements —
  it’s useful to consider various ways of looking at the
  problem without seeing it as a threat.

### Connectivity

**Connectivity** of a relationship captures
the degree of openness to new ways of thinking and doing things.
If there’s good connectivity in the relationship, people
feel more comfortable to open themselves up to new approaches.
Connectivity facilitates non-defensive reactions and encourages
members to be open to and speak up about new challenges.

How can we **enhance connectivity**?

* **DON’T** be too rigid and
  judgemental, if you attack divergent ideas, people might be
  afraid to share their opinions with you.
* **DON’T** assume, that you are always
  correct and others are wrong or people won’t be willing to
  share their thoughts with you.
* **DO**find something to agree on.
* **DO**get curious and ask questions to find
  something useful for you and make the other person feel like
  you value their ideas (as long as you actually do).

### Positive regard

**Positive regard** is a feeling of being
known and respected by people around you. If you believe that
others see you as competent, you don’t feel judged or monitored
and you can share your viewpoints, without fear of harming your
image. If people know that they are appreciated and valued, they
feel a sense of social dignity, reinforcing their self-esteem
and competence

How can we **build positive regard**?

* **DO** find opportunities to honsetly
  appreciate your co-workers. How often do you appreciate your
  co-workers or employees right now? How often do they
  appreciate something you did
* When thinking about something surprising someone
  did, **DO** ask yourself: What can I
  learn from that person?

### Mutuality

Mutuality is a way of participating in a shared activity in
which each person is involved as fully as possible.

How can we **enhance mutuality**?

* **DO**refer to a common goal. For example
  when you are giving feedback.
* Is there a balance in your relationship? Is there someone who
  is asking for more
  favors? **DON’T** let the other
  person feel used and **DO** protect
  yourself if you are the one feeling used.

## Psychological safety – not as pleasant as it sounds

When we are thinking about the word ‘safety’, we might imagine
sitting under a warm blanket with a mug of hot tea and a
favorite book. We might imagine a situation when we are not
threatened by anything and we don’t have to face any challenges.

The concept of psychological safety is not as pleasant. The aim
is not to quietly work with your colleagues or a stress-free
workplace. The aim is to be able to show your emotions (also the
difficult ones), doubt if the existing solutions are optimal or
fight for a common goal.

## Psychological safety in your team

On a scale of 1-10 how would you rate the level of psychological
safety on your team?

What would it mean for you and your team to increase that level?
