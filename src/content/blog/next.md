Leadership Career](http://growtogether.academy/book?ref=localhost)"*

When you feel stuck on the way to your long term goals or
confused about what those goals should even be – don't despair –
you don't need to know everything!

The only question you need to answer is
**what to do next**?

## Now or Not Now

A common cause of stuckness is trying to consider all options
one by one.

If you consider each idea on it's own you *will* become
overwhelmed.

You can never implement all ideas that have *some* value.
Most of them do.

On the other hand our human instinct is to not lose good ideas
so you might invest a lot in trying to capture and organize
those ideas for easy reference later.

This is almost always a waste of time and a breeding ground for
procrastination.

Instead notice that there is only one real decision to make
about priorities:

1. NOW
2. not now

The *NOW* category is inherently limited. Even if you're
working with a big and super-competent team you can only do so
much in a given day, week or month.

This means that the key question is not "*Which ideas are good ideas?*", but rather "***What is most important now*** *given our limited resources?*".

So what about the *not now* category? Aren't there good
ideas there too.

Yes!

But I submit that most of the time it's safe and efficient to
**just delete them**.

When the time comes to make another planning decision you will
have a bunch of new ideas available. If one of the ideas you
have on your list now is truly great it will probably resurface.
If not then maybe it's for the best for it to be forgotten.

There's a relatively small subset of ideas that are unlikeley to
reappear but also important not to forget – go ahead and store
them (perhaps in your calendar). Use this sparingly otherwise
your will end up right where you started – overwhelmed and stuck
under the weight of too many options.

## Forget Optimal

Another common source of stuckness is trying to make optimal
decisions.

As a physics/math/cs student I was steeped in the kind of
problems that have concrete solutions and commonly the task
called for finding the absolute best one.

This is impossible in most real life situations.

You just don't have the information or the processing power to
shoot for optimal.

What you can do instead is what the military might call
*reconnaissance by combat*. Attack the problem in front
of you and learn from the experience.

Instead of optimal your next step should be
***good enough for now**,*
***safe enough to try*** and
***short enough to learn quickly****.*

## Ship something every week

If you're stuck or confused get unstuck by shipping something in
under one week.

If you're clear and running full steam ahead also consider
extracting smaller chunks you can ship within a week. People
will benefit sooner and you might find out something surprising
and adjust your long term plans.

How to chose what to ship:

1. Can it be **done in under a week**?
2. If successful, will it
   **make someone's life better**?
3. Can you **learn from it**?

**Plan** it, **do** it, then
**reflect** on it.

Now what are you going to ship this week?
