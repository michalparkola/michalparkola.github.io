The more useful stuff you have in a well-organized, densely
interconnectedÂ **team information system**,
the richer your interactions can become.

A great TIM can be like aÂ **beautiful garden**Â where things can stack up, grow and interweave in ways
that would be impossible without the right environment.

Ok, MichaÅ‚. Colorful metaphors are nice, but what do
IÂ *do*?

Glad you asked!

I like to use this three step loop which I call AsyncABC:

1. **Align**Â to needs
2. Package information into usefulÂ **Blocks**
3. **Connect**Â everything
