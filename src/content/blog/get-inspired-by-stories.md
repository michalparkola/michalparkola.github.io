To go far you need a large tank of high-octane fuel—or even
better, a steady supply of **renewable energy**.

You need to be able to tap into powerful drivers that actually
move people to do things.

And as a leader, you need to **start with yourself**.

Otherwise, you simply won’t get very far.

For example, I always had money-related goals on my mind. Sadly
they never moved me to do much of anything. The things that
actually happened, I did for other reasons and money was a side
effect. Important, but never the primary thing.

To create a strong, motivating vision we must take into accounts
three aspects:

1. what **you** want,
2. what **other people** want,
3. **what might be possible together**.

Each can take many forms, but there is one thing that unifies
all three. When you dig deeply into what moves people it’s
likely you will find *stories*.

### Get inspired by stories

When you look closely our goals do not typically appear out of
the blue. They are often created by comparing our situation to a
narrative about other people’s experience. As humans we
have a strong
[tendency to mimic each other](https://perell.com/essay/peter-thiel/?ref=localhost). And there is no better vehicle than a story to communicate
important challenges and and behaviours of those who stand up to
them.

The idea for Grow Together Academy was also inspired by
many *stories*.

That includes stories from our own experience working with many
teams and many leaders, stories from the best books we’ve
read, stories from the best offline and online courses
we’ve attended, and stories from the ones we’ve
designed & delivered ourselves.

Stories from great books like [7 Habits of Highly Effective People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People?ref=localhost), [Time to Think](https://www.timetothink.com/?ref=localhost), and [From Contempt to Curiosity](https://www.amazon.com/Contempt-Curiosity-Conditions-Collaborate-Modelling/dp/0957486618?ref=localhost).

Stories from movies and TV shows about how teams and leaders can
behave at their best and worst, including: Star Trek, Dune, and
Lord of the Rings.

And most relevant for the type of experience we’re
creating right now, there are the stories of several excellent
online cohort-based courses that I attended, including [Seth Godin’s AltMBA](https://altmba.com/?ref=localhost) (I was part of cohort 33), [Building a Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/?ref=localhost)(cohort 11) or
[a Polish course about building courses](https://akademia.pl/fabryka?ref=localhost).

It’s stories all the way down.

But to make the best use of stories we need one more thing: we
need to ground them in our own reality. To relate them to the
things we see, hear and do in our immediate environment. But
this is a topic for another time (and one which we will
definitely dig into during Grow Together Academy).

And what stories inspire YOU when it comes to leadership and
collaboration? What epic heroes would you most like to be like?
The vibe of which amazing teams would you love to replicate?
