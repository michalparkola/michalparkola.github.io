One problem with remote work is that itâ€™s
even easier for misunderstandings to occur.

Itâ€™s hard even when weâ€™re working from the same
physical space and have multiple opportunities to talk face to
face every day. But now? Fuggedaboutit!

Left unaddressed those misunderstandings can quickly
escalate into destructive conflicts.

One way to deal with this risk is to develop the habit of
explicitly considering different viewpoints.

When you see or hear something you think is
*obviously* incorrect, try asking yourself:

How might this make sense?

Resist the urge to immediately dismiss things that are not
aligned with your current way of thinking.

Put yourself in other peopleâ€™s shoes and think
what might lead someone to think or act this way?
What value might they be trying to protect?

This does NOT mean that you have to accept it. You might still
disagree and act accordingly.

Then again you might notice something you have not considered
before and expand your view of the world.

Letâ€™s say your company want to introduce time tracking.

What is your reaction?

Absurd?

Idiotic?

They should trust us?

Pause!

What if we
[assume positive intent](https://fluidcircle.net/2020/09/18/assume-positive-intent/?ref=localhost)?

What might they be trying to achieve?

Protect the company? Keep things in good order? Improve
transparency?

Maybe even protect the team from working too many hours?

Without more information you donâ€™t really know which
interpretation is best. It might not be the most positive one,
but it might not be your initial one either.

Itâ€™s useful to train this kind of openness to different
ways of thinking, even if in the end you decide to stick to your
original judgement.

During the upcoming week try to notice things that you disagree
with, pause and try to peel back a layer or two to uncover the
deeper assumptions hiding behind them.

It could be what someone said.

It could be what someone did.

It could be something you read.

An imperfect piece of code.

A strange design.

For a bit of advanced practice take a look at the culture of a
foreign country and try to figure out how their weird customs
could make sense in their circumstances.
