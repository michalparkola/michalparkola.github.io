### The trouble with feedback

I have mixed feelings about feedback. In my own life I have
grown tremendously by accepting direct feedback from people I
trust and respect. On the other hand I hate it when someone uses
a demeaning label on me and expects me to be grateful for the
opportunity to improve.

I have also pissed many people off with my subjective
judgements, but sometimes I did manage to positively influence
people in a honest and comapassionate way.

Here are some notes that I want to remember when I’m faced with
giving or getting feedback in the future. Let me know if this
approach works for you as well.

### Ask for feedback

I’ve just left my job after almost a year as a Product Owner
working with several teams of software engineers. To put it
mildly I was dissatisfied with the specific ways that my
organization went about the topic of peer review so I decided to
take matters into my own hands and ask for direct, anonymous
feedback from everyone I’ve worked with. I created a Google Form
with one numerical and two open-ended questions with a note
asking for the feedback to be constructive and that specific
examples would be most helpful.

The questions were:

1. Would you like to work with Michał in the future? (1-10)
2. What did you like the most about working with Michał?
3. What did you dislike the most about working with Michał?

### The results

I got 10 responses (roughly the number of people I worked with)
and got a 75% average result on the want-to-work-with question.
Direct feedback (even anonymous) may be more positive then
reality but, even slightly discounted, this result makes me
happy. Despite all the mistakes I’ve made I seem to have had a
net positive impact on my teammates.

That’s mostly a vanity metric though, so the open-ended
questions ware there to provide more actionable ideas. The
respondents told me what I should apply even more of
(enthusiasm, knowledge, adaptability) and what I should improve
(be less forceful with “the right way” to do things).

### A story of reconciliation

One specific response surprised me the most: I got feedback from
the person I had the most “trouble” with. The one I would expect
would give me a score near zero (described in the form as “would
rather be chopped to bits”). Instead he gave me a 7 and not only
that: he gave me the most comprehensive answers to the other two
questions with very useful comments regarding how he perceived
my attempts to make our teams more Agile.

That was valuable in itself but beyond that it put our
relationship in a completely new light. We will not be able to
benefit directly since I’ve just left the company, but it did
remove one of the most painful thorns that would otherwise have
troubled me for a long time. Thank you!

### Make it direct and anonymous

Overall I believe the most important thing was to make sure that
the feedback was direct and anonymous (unless someone chose to
identify himself). Without that I think the results would be
skewed too much to be useful.

### Give honest feedback with kindness and compassion

When I’m ever in a situation where I’m the one giving feedback
here are some things I’d like to remember to ask:

* Does the recipient want the feedback or is it about me wanting
  to express my judgement (or worse: hurt that person)?
* If someone gave me the feedback I’m about to give, would I
  find it helpful or hurtful?
* Does the feedback include concrete examples or is it a bunch
  of generalizations?

I strongly believe asking those questions will make my feedback
more readily accepted and my relationships with those I give my
feedback to will be strengthened instead of strained.

### Deliberate practice

Feedback is one of the necessary conditions for significant
growth and a lot more can be written about it so expect future
posts to continue the topic, including:

* As a team member: How can you use feedback to grow as
  individuals and as a team?
* As a manager: how can you help the people in your organization
  by encouraging a culture of asking for and giving honest and
  non-aggressive feedback?
