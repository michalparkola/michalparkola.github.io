*Live your differentiators*

If you want to create a successful product or service a common
piece of advice I hear is to “wow” your customers.

To deliver such moments of sheer delight that they will never
forget it.

If you’re a leader the same goes for creating a great employee
experience.

This advice can be misleading.

One problem with “wow” effects is due to a natural human
mechanism of *hedonic adaptation*.

Humans get used to a new normal very quickly and come to seek
out more and more *hits* of the *emotional high* that you were trying to target.

Don’t chase that high.

Instead ask yourself:

**What do I want my product or service to be*****remembered for*****?**

And don’t settle for generic statements like *high quality*.

Ask: *what kind* *of quality*?

Be specific.

I want \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to be *remembered for*:

1. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
2. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
3. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

And when 1, 2, 3: *what happens then*?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

What does that *look, sound and feel like*?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Now you’re ready to start **putting that into practice**.

And **never stop**.

You know you’re on the right track when people
start **telling each others stories** about how you’re **consistently delivering** ***your kind*****of quality**.
