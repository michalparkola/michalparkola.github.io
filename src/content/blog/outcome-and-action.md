If you want to **do** something, but you’re **stuck**
it might be because you lack ****clarity**** about the
exact **outcome** you’d like to
make happen and the
concrete **action** you need to take to
get there.

**When?**

It might be when you’re spinning your wheels on your own
…

… or when you’re caught in an endless planning
meeting.

Either way clarifying can help.

**Clarify** to reduce the risk of unpleasant
surprises — if things are unclear, you’re unlikely to get
what you want.

**Clarify** to get unstuck — ambiguity is
a major driver of procrastination.

**How?**

First **clarify the outcome**:

Pick a topic that’s important to you and let’s do it
right now.

Question 1: *And what would you **like to have happen***?

Your answer:
……………………………….

Question 2: ***How will you know** that it happened*?

Describe direct sensory experiences. What will you be able
to **see**, **hear**, **touch**, **smell** or **taste**?

This sounds simple, but it can be surprisingly hard. Our heads
are full of abstract concepts that we equate with reality and we
don’t often look at the world without that lense. And
while all those concepts are essential for us to function in the
world, it’s a powerful skill to be able to look at the
ground reality beneath.

For example:

I want to improve usability.

I will know I have improved usability when the system is easier
to use.

What does *easier* look like? What does it
sound like? Can you touch easier? Can you smell it?!

How about: Given a task and 5 users, at least 4 of them complete
the task within 10 seconds.

Now that’s something you can *see*. Start the
clock. Go. Task complete. Where is the seconds hand?

It might feel pedantic at first — but I promise —
it *will* pay dividends.

Ok, back to your topic: How will you know that it happened?

Your answer:
……………………………….

Finally we’re ready for question 3: ***Why is this important**to you*?

A key part to provide motivation for actually following through
with the plan.

Or deciding it’s not worth doing after all!

Your answer:
……………………………….

Then **clarify the action:**

It should be pretty easy now.

In a group context ask: *Who? What? When?*

In an individual context ask: *What is the next concrete action I need to take?*

Your
answer: ……………………………….

Clear?

Go on, do it :)
