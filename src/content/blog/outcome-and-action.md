If you want toÂ **do**Â something, but youâ€™reÂ **stuck**
it might be because you lackÂ ****clarity****Â about the
exactÂ **outcome**Â youâ€™d like to
make happen and the
concreteÂ **action**Â you need to take to
get there.

**When?**

It might be when youâ€™re spinning your wheels on your own
â€¦

â€¦ or when youâ€™re caught in an endless planning
meeting.

Either way clarifying can help.

**Clarify**Â to reduce the risk of unpleasant
surprises â€” if things are unclear, youâ€™re unlikely to get
what you want.

**Clarify**Â to get unstuckÂ â€” ambiguity is
a major driver of procrastination.

**How?**

FirstÂ **clarify the outcome**:

Pick a topic thatâ€™s important to you and letâ€™s do it
right now.

Question 1:Â *And what would youÂ **like to have happen***?

Your answer:
â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦.

Question 2:Â ***How will you know**Â that it happened*?

Describe direct sensory experiences. What will you be able
toÂ **see**,Â **hear**,Â **touch**,Â **smell**Â orÂ **taste**?

This sounds simple, but it can be surprisingly hard. Our heads
are full of abstract concepts that we equate with reality and we
donâ€™t often look at the world without that lense. And
while all those concepts are essential for us to function in the
world, itâ€™s a powerful skill to be able to look at the
ground reality beneath.

For example:

I want to improve usability.

I will know I have improved usability when the system is easier
to use.

What doesÂ *easier*Â look like? What does it
sound like? Can you touch easier? Can you smell it?!

How about: Given a task and 5 users, at least 4 of them complete
the task within 10 seconds.

Now thatâ€™s something you canÂ *see*. Start the
clock. Go. Task complete. Where is the seconds hand?

It might feel pedantic at first â€” but I promise â€”
itÂ *will*Â pay dividends.

Ok, back to your topic: How will you know that it happened?

Your answer:
â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦.

Finally weâ€™re ready for question 3:Â ***Why is this important**to you*?

A key part to provide motivation for actually following through
with the plan.

Or deciding itâ€™s not worth doing after all!

Your answer:
â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦.

ThenÂ **clarify the action:**

It should be pretty easy now.

In a group context ask:Â *Who? What? When?*

In an individual context ask:Â *What is the next concrete action I need to take?*

Your
answer:Â â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦.

Clear?

Go on, do it :)
