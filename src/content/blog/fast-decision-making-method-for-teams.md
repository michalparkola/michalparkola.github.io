Here’s one way to **get to the point faster** and also to **make group decisions** that have a much higher chance of sticking.

## 1) Make your decisions in a concrete, concise and meaningful way

A decision-making process is a form of communication, and
we have a useful framework for making communication better —
it’s CCM:

1. Be [CONCISE](https://fluidcircle.net/2020/10/20/make-your-communication-concise/?ref=localhost): Start with the most important point. Skip the
   long-winded introduction and the full history that led you to
   the idea.
2. State your proposal in a [CONCRETE](https://fluidcircle.net/2020/10/15/make-your-communication-concrete/?ref=localhost), unambiguous way: You want who, to do what, when? What will
   you be able to see, hear or touch?
3. Use this process only for [MEANINGFUL](https://fluidcircle.net/2020/10/22/meaningful/?ref=localhost) decisions to avoid agreement fatigue and make sure that
   the agreements you do make will stick.

## 2) Celebrate objections as the valuable input that they are

If you make decisions through a typical majority vote some
objections will be overruled.  
  
Those objections might
have been pointing out major obstacles and overruling them will
not make those obstacles go away.  
  
On top of
that the people who had those objections will probably not
let them go just because they lost the vote. They’re
way more likely to ignore or even undermine the decision
later.  
  
On the other hand full-consensus is probably
too much to ask all the time.  
  
There’s a
middle-way: soft-consensus.  
  
There are three ways to
respond to a proposal:  
  
1. An
enthusiastic **YES**!  
2. A
neutral **OK** — I’m not against
AND I WILL SUPPORT the implementation.  
3.
I’m **AGAINST** the
proposal **IN IT’S CURRENT FORM**.  
  
The “*in it’s current form*” is the key part.  
  
If we aim at
soft-consensus we’re aiming to make decisions that no one
is strongly against.  
  
If someone is against the
proposal (in it’s current form) that’s great! They
are not the enemy who is trying to sabotage your plan.
They’re your best supporter who will help you avoid major
pitfalls!

## 3) Talk about what you DO want, not what you DON’T want

Now comes the magic part that delivers the biggest
babble-cutting power:  
  
When someone has an
objection don’t ask “*Why?*“  
  
Instead
DO ask:  
  
“***How would the proposal need to change for you to be at
least OK with it?***“  
  
Detailed explanations might come later, if
needed, but always start with this question.  
  
You’ll
be surprised how often the modification will be acceptable to
everybody and not a single sentence more is required.  
  
Once
you get into this habit you’ll not even have to ask: most
objections will come with an automatic counter-proposal.  
  
Even
if the proposal does not pass you will have a much clearer
idea where the disagreement is.
