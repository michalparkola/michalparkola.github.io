If you donâ€™t know what you want, youâ€™re probably not
going to get it.

So to help you figure things out here are three things that
helped me:

## Exploring Personal Priorities

Please find a calm place, take some time and
**ask yourself**:

1. For 2021 to be your best year ever it would be like what?
2. For 2021 to be *like that* â€“ youâ€™d like to be
   like what?
3. For 2021 to be *like that* and for you to be
   *like so* â€“ what support do you need?

**Write down your answers** and explore a bit:

* What kind of â€¦?
* Is there anything else about â€¦?
* How will I know?
* And when â€¦, what happens next?

Iâ€™m sure it will help you clarify your priorities.

## Seeing the Big Picture

In order to have a big picture overview of my whole life and
make more detailed planning easier I like to keep a list of
highest level priorities against which all other ideas can be
judged.

For each area I add 4-10 statements describing what I want to
have happen (or keep happening) in that area.

For example mine are:

1. Healthy & Fit
2. Happy Family & Good Friends
3. Satisfying Career Pursuing Freedm, Purpose and Relationships
4. Responsible Upkeep = Taking Good Care of Things
5. Having Fun, Playing Games, Exploring

Some areas contain a checklist of sub-areas I need to take care
of individually. For example Healthy & Fit contains:

* Healthy, delicious, ethical and ecological food
* Movement: strength, energy, flexibility
* Mental health
* Sleep
* Teeth
* Healthchecks

Some areas have more general aspirational statements like in
Career:

* Iâ€™m enjoying financial and creative freedom.
* Iâ€™m energized by several productive partnerships with
  high-competence and high-integrity professionals.
* Weâ€™re making peopleâ€™s lives observably better.

What this is doing for me is that it makes other decisions
easier and lowers my overal anxiety about things.

When a topic comes up I put it in the appropriate area and
relate it to the main outcomes that I want in that area â€“ a lot
of the time that thing I was worrying about is in one of the
lower categories or is not an obstacle to the things I really
want, so I donâ€™t need to ruminate on it too much.

Also when I scan the whole list it gives me a sense of calm that
Iâ€™m not forgetting something important.

What about you?

1. What are **your top areas** that you want to take
   care of in 2021?
2. For each area: what are the main outcomes or sub-areas you
   care about most?
   1. If you have many, what are the top 10?
   2. â€¦ top 3?
   3. â€¦ top 1 in each area?

## Breaking Down Ambitious Goals

Another tactic that Iâ€™m playing with is the concept of
*progressions* simplified to three levels as
[described by Mirek Burnejko](https://trzypoziomy.pl/?ref=localhost).

It helps bridge the gap between ambitious goals, and achievable
milestones on your way to that ultimate reward.

For example in fitness my fantasy is to be able to do a full
[press to handstand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW_ljV5CBKk&ref=localhost), but if I just think about that goal it seems too far away and
I end up not doing much. So I broke it down and now Iâ€™m
working towards a much more realistic 60 sec wall handstand.
After I hit that goal I can take on the next challenge and in
that way build momentum on a multi-year journey that the full
press will take:

* Level 1) 60 sec wall HS (Iâ€™m close)
* Level 2) 30 sec free HS + HS Pirouette (Iâ€™ll be happy to
  hit this in 2021)
* Level 3) Press to HS (this will likely take multiple years)

Another example is the three levels of aspiration for my
coaching & teaching work:

* Level 1) Help individual people be happy & effective
* Level 2) Help teams create and learn together
* Level 3) Foster thriving communities

The ultimate expression of success in this areas is thriving
communities, but itâ€™s helpful to focus on the building
blocks first which is individuals and then teams.

**How would you** break down your most relevant
ambition?

1. â€¦
2. â€¦
3. â€¦

See you in 2021!
