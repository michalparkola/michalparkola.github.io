# What do pro athletes do all day?

Let‚Äôs say you want to become a world-class athlete.

You wouldn‚Äôt expect to get strong from lifting a barbell
once and you wouldn‚Äôt exect to win games against competent
opponents after practicing for an hour or four.

No.

You start with an intro and then practice, practice, practice
for weeks, months and years. In fact while you‚Äôre playing
at a pro level you never stop practicing.

You don‚Äôt just show up at games and expect to perform at a
high-level. You spend most of your time preparing so that when
it‚Äôs time, you‚Äôre ready to kick ass.

And it‚Äôs not just any kind of practice. You practice
*deliberately*.

You reflect on your current strengths and weaknesses, you pick a
target just outside your current ability, you try it, you get
immediate feedback, you reflect, and repeat, repeat, repeat.

# Train for creative knowledge work like an athlete trains for their sport

As creative knowledge workers why do we so often settle for a
2-day training here and a book there? Why do things like sitting
down to read at the office seem so strange in most
organizations? Or to meet in a group and just practice together?

To get good at professional skills I believe we need to adopt an
athlete mentality.

If you want to communicate well so that people understand you
and want to work with you.

If you want to run meetings that lead to meaningful insights and
decisions and not burn time on aimless discussions.

If you want everyone on your team to know everything they need
without being overloaded with less relevant details.

If you want to do all that and more I suggest you need to at
least:

1. **Define** the skills you want to improve ‚Äì What
   *outcomes* are you looking for? What concrete
   *actions* lead to those outcomes? How do you know
   *how well* you‚Äôre doing?
2. **Practice** those skills over and over again. By
   all means, learn from experts but while you‚Äôre doing
   that extract concrete actions and deliberately practice the
   ones that make the biggest difference for you. Use
   *spaced repetition* to reinforce key skills while
   leaving room for adding new skills to your training roster.
3. **Find others** who are interested in the same
   skills and practice together.

# What‚Äôs one rep?

Before we can train we need to translate abstract skills into
**concrete actions**.

It‚Äôs useful to group those actions into
**progressions** and do the one that is most
appropriate at your current level.

Let‚Äôs take a single leg squat:

1. One rep at level one might be lowering yourself on one leg
   until your ass touches a chair.
2. Level two might require you to do a full single leg squat
   while holding on to a post or door handle or another solid
   support.
3. And finally at level three you might do a complete,
   freestanding single leg squat.

When you can do 10 easy reps in one level, move on to the next.

Now let‚Äôs consider writing. What‚Äôs one rep?

Starting from absolute basics and building up:

1. Write a sentence summarising something you‚Äôre reading or
   thinking about.
2. Write or improve an
   [evergreen note](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes?ref=localhost)
   on a subject you care about.
3. Write and publish a short piece about something you learned
   recently.

It‚Äôs not enough to know that good writing is

or
[that](https://fluidcircle.net/2020/10/20/make-your-communication-concise/?ref=localhost). Let‚Äôs practice it. In various contexts, with various
kinds of people on the receiving end.

Practice.

# How to practice understanding people

Using the LAO framework introduced in
[üíõ Make Your Communication Meaningful (For Your Intended
Audience)](https://fluidcircle.net/2020/10/22/meaningful/?ref=localhost)

**Listen**: Don‚Äôt talk. Just listen. If
there‚Äôs a lull in the conversation then ask a short
question and listen some more.

One rep is one instance where you‚Äôre leaning towards a
judgement but you swing to curiosity instead.

**Ask**: Direct the spotlight of attention to
explore without introducing your own assumptions. Ask clean
questions like *What kind of ‚Ä¶* or
*Is there anything else about ‚Ä¶* or
*And then what?* Ask them gently to encourage the speaker
to share more or even discover new things about themselves.
Don‚Äôt let it turn into an interrogation.

One rep is one thing you find out that you didn‚Äôt know
before.

**Observe**: Notice behaviors and decisions. Stop
short of interpreting or judging or at least separate what you
saw and heard from what you interpret it to mean.

One rep is one concrete action noted separately from your
analysis of it.

And what what skill would you most like to practice, practice,
practice?
