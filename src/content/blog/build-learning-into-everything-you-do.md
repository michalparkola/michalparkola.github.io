Hello there!

Around 2015, I believed that online training could be better
than live training, so I started experimenting under the name
“People Skills for Geeks.”

By the end of 2019, I had *proof.* Thanks to
those early experiments and my experience in Seth Godin’s
AltMBA (cohort 33).

As I write this in early 2021 the point is pretty much moot —
almost all learning is online.

So instead of
comparing *online* and *live* I
will share the best ways I know to learn online in 2021.

It is a hot topic for us [Michał and Richard] as we design Grow
Together and it might also help you improve your own learning or
even create learning experiences for others.

First of all I need to share a core belief:

*Learning is behavior change*

*that leads to better expected results.*

No behavior change => no learning.

With that in mind:

As much as possible *do the actual thing.* In
the case of GTA it means to create and to learn together.

## Create together

In GTA you will work in small groups to create something
meaningful with others.

Something none of you would likely not be able to create on our
own.

It can be a powerful experience to work through difficult issues
with a small group**.**

Especially if that group was brought together from all over the
world and has bonded over several weeks of working together.

For example one course I’ve attended not long ago included
people from the UK, Sweden, Poland, Germany, France, Australia
and Singapore. This variety helped see the problem we were
working on from different perspectives and learn that much
faster.

## Learn together

Learning by doing is a strong start, but there is more.

As you probably know muscles grow during recover not during a
workout.

And so it is with learning. Most of it happens when
you *reflect* on what you did after you did it.

And it’s even better if you’re surrounded by
perceptive teammates who will help you by sharing their
observations and opinions for you to consider.

In GT you will be invited to regularly share your reflections
with other students. You will also be invited to do the same for
others which will boost your learning even further. It will help
you clarify your thinking and give you a chance to grapple with
a wider variety of situations.

We call this The Learning Loop or the Plan-Do-Reflect (PDR) loop
and it is one of the pillars of our own learning and the whole
Grow Together program.

The beauty of this part is that as you *learn with the group* during the program you also *learn how to learn* and you will be able to bring the same methods to your
team so that more learning can happen there too.

## Long term learning

I could go on all day about designing online learning
experiences. And one day I might. But today I will leave you
with a promise that Grow Together Academy will be unlike
anything you’ve experienced in the past.

By being a participant from the very first cohort you can help
us achieve that goal and then follow the evolution of the
program in future cohorts, which will be free to join for
alumni.

See you soon,

Michał and Richard
