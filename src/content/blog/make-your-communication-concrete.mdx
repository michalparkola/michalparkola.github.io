In the previous One Minute Tip we covered one of
the **three key skills of remote work**,
namely to [communicate well in short chunks of writing](https://remoteleader.substack.com/p/communicate-well-in-short-chunks?ref=localhost).

We ended that tip with the statement that **good communication is CCM**: **concrete**, **concise** and **meaningful**.

Now we will make that tip more *concrete*.

My favorite ways to make communication more concrete are:

---

1) [Show, don’t tell](https://remoteleader.substack.com/p/show-it?ref=localhost) (covered in the very first One Minute Tip):

* in meetings: whenever you talk about something — **share your screen and show it**, if it doesn’t exist yet — create it (at least give it a
  name and address and some initial notes to be developed
  later),
* in text: whenever you mention something —**link to it**.

---

2) If the communication is related to some kind of action or
event — make sure there are clear answers to the [five core journalistic questions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws?ref=localhost): **Who? What? When? Where?**and **Why?** (for what purpose) as well
as the bonus question **How?**

Start with the top 3: Who? What? When?

Make it a habit.

Who, What, When

WhoWhatWhen

WHO WHAT WHEN

Not all communication requires this level of concreteness,

but if it’s missing

don’t expect conrete results.

3) “*When in doubt spell it out!*”

If you’re responsible for the work of more than one person
you’re better off erring on the side of caution and
over-communicating.

Make references concrete.

[Explicit is better than implicit](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/?ref=localhost).

Perhaps even say the same thing in a few different ways.

Here’s what I mean:

**bad**: “*let’s learn to communicate better*” ([everyone agrees, and likely nothing will happen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wfq2YpcubSs&ref=localhost))

**better**: “*let’s practice communicating better with short chunks of
writing this Friday at 3pm on Zoom*” (concrete who, what, when / people might not be interested
but at least it will be clear)

**best**: “*let’s practice [communicating better with short chunks of writing](https://remoteleader.substack.com/p/communicate-well-in-short-chunks?ref=localhost) this Friday at 3pm on Zoom*” (who what when & a link to more information for the
people who want it)

Try it!

PS. Next tip will be about how to make your
communication *concise*.
