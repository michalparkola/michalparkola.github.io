My university career spanned 7 years, 3 departments and ended in
me dropping out.  
  
There is one thing I learned during
that time that helped me build a successful career without a
degree.  
  
Ok, 7 thingsðŸ‘‡  

1) Be
proactive  
  
Do not wait for the things you want (or
believe in) to materialize out of thin air.  
  
Look for
opportunities to increase the odds of success. When faced with
obstacles, let "What CAN I do in this situation" become your
mantra.  

2) Begin with the end in mind  
  
If
you're stuck it's often because you're not clear enough about
the outcome.  
  
Be concrete - what will you:  
  
â€¢
see  
â€¢ hear  
â€¢ touch  
â€¢ smell  
â€¢ taste  
  
when
the task is done?  
  
You do NOT need perfect clarity,
just enough to take the next step.  

3) Put 1st
things 1st  
  
Look at your list of goals. Rank them to
identify the top 10, top 3 and top 1.  
  
Now look at
your calendar. Add entries roughly estimating how you spend your
time.  
  
Do you allocate time roughly according to your
priorities?  

4) Seek first to
understand, then to be understood  
  
I've wasted so much
time trying to explain why people are wrong about something.  
  
Now
I know that the key to convincing people is first understanding
them better.  
  
I do that using LAO: Listen, Ask,
Observe  

5) Think win-win  
  
To
succeed in life you need to take into account the perspectives
and needs of the people you interact with: bosses, customers,
team mates, partners, friends...  
  
All those
relationships will fall apart if you play win-lose.  
  
So
play for win-win :)  

6) Synergize  
  
This
word became so overused it became a joke about empty corporate
slogans.  
  
It's time to bring it back.  
  
When
you work with people look for ways to amplify each other - like
a laser bouncing photons between two mirrors and resulting in a
powerful beam.  

7) Sharpen the saw  
  
There
is production and then there's production capability. If you do
the same thing over and over again without rest or learning you
will just burn out.  
  
Intentionally set aside time
to  
  
a) rest and regenarate  
b) learn (or invent!)
better ways of doing things  

That's it.  
  
Those
are the 7 things I learned during my collage years that allowed
me to build a successful career despite not getting a degree.  
  
So
how did I learn all that?  

Sharp eyed readers
will of course recognize the source of these lessons  
  
It's
"*The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People*" by Stephen
Covey  
  
I recommend the audiobook version even more
than the book itself. I believe it contains the essence of the
habits in a more concise form.
