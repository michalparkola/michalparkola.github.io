Our purpose with
[Grow Together Academy](http://growtogether.academy/?ref=localhost)
is to help moreÂ **great teams**Â happen.

Great teams thatÂ **create and learn together**.

Great teams that get amazing results, without creating
casualties.

That is not always easy.

Sometimes the winds are against us and sometimes we might even
find ourselves in aÂ **pitÂ of despair**.

It can be hard to climb out of aÂ pitÂ of despair.

But rarely is all hope lost, so here are some things to try in
common scenarios.

## PitÂ 1: Everyone for themselves

In thisÂ pitÂ there is no shared purpose. People are
doing things to get what they want, but thereâ€™s not much
collaboration, in fact people sometimes get in each others way
and fight.

**Best case**: everyone does their own thing
independent of others.

There is one more insidious variant here, which we could call
hidden misalignment. It happens when there theoretically is a
shared purpose in the abstract but people differ on the real
world translation. Perhaps without realizing it.

For example:

*Letâ€™s make the world a better place!*

*Andy: Better place? Yes! More freedom!*

*Ben: Better place? Yes! More order!*

**Worst case**: a classic rat race. Success is
mostly individual, helping others means wasting resources or
even harming your own chances. For some people to win, others
have to lose.

**What to do if youâ€™re in thisÂ pitÂ (and you
canâ€™t or donâ€™t want to leave):**

Find allies. Start with a shared interest. Preferably one that
is narrow and specific.

## PitÂ 2: Itâ€™s crap

In thisÂ pitÂ the things we make or do are not good
enough â€“ software is slow and keeps crashing, roofs leak, walls
are crooked, games are lost, missions fail.

This is a relatively easy one, as long as people care.

**What to do with your team:**

1. Find a strong enough WHY for improvement for example
   byÂ getting inspired by stories and grounding them in your
   reality.
2. Donâ€™t dwell too long on what you do NOT want (i.e. the
   problem). As soon as possible translate it into something you
   DO want (a desired outcome) and focus on that instead.
3. Find what IS working well andÂ turn up the good.
4. Find theÂ next best improvementÂ and attack it.
5. Learn continuously with theÂ Plan-Do-Reflect loop.

## PitÂ 3: No one cares

This might be the worst one of the three.

In thisÂ pitÂ people are deep in learned helplessness
and stupor.

They might say things like:

*So many attempts failed before, this one will fail as
wellâ€¦*

Or they might be busy with their lives outside of the team and
team-related opportunities donâ€™t seem attractive enough to
move them.

**What to do when people donâ€™t care (yet)?**

1. Find out what people DO care about. Find ways to align those
   benefits with the team purpose. Or at least balance them.
2. Create aÂ smell of success. Make something good happen and
   generate evidence that good things are possible afterall.

## Build your ladder, rung by rung

In Grow Together Academy we practice most of those strategies to
give you practical tools, not just for when everything is going
smoothly, but also for more difficult situations.
