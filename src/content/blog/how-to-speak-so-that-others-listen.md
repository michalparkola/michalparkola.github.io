The first topic is a simple but powerful model that has helped
me greatly. Now it can also help you, so without further ado:

### Are people listening to what you have to say?

How often do you try to convince someone with your superior
logic only to have them ignore your obvious wisdom?

The method known since ancient times tells us to consider three
factors:

* *ethos* or personal credibility,
* *pathos* or a worthy purpose,
* and only then *logos* or rational arguments.

### Ethos: Why should I listen to you?

Here are some facts:

* I have learned from painful experience: in relationships, at
  work and in business,
* I have read a dozen books and hundreds of articles on the
  subject,
* I have spoken at local meetups as well as international
  conferences,

and most importantly:

* despite no formal sales training and an aversion to the
  activity I managed to connect with enough people to sell
  $100k worth of training through my Agile consultancy and more
  then double my salary when I returned to the job market a year
  ago.

Does this make everything I say true? Of course not, but does it
make you more open to listening to what I have to say compared
to a random person you know nothing about? I’ll bet it
does.

### Pathos: What’s in it for me?

How do you feel when something is really important to you, but
the people around you don’t seem to respond?

Can you imagine what you could accomplish if you managed to find
better ways to (openly and honestly) persuade the most important
people in your life? Your spouse? Your children? Your boss? What
would that mean to you?

Understand what your audience wants and you will understand why
they ignore something that’s obviously (to you!) so very
important. Help them see how your idea will bring them closer to
what they want and you will earn both their attention and their
gratitude.

### Logos: Now I’m ready to hear the logic

Are you trustwortly in their eyes? Is what you have to say
important to them? Now you can get to the what and the how. It
still has to make sense, but you’ll have a much easier
time if you have made a genuine connection on the level of ethos
and pathos.

### Use with care

Don’t try to use this method to manipulate people into
doing something that is not in their best interest. People will
catch on sooner or later and you will suffer horribly. I
don’t want you to suffer; so don’t do it!
