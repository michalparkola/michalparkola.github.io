## Whose Space is it Anyway?

What do you do right after you rent a new space?

You move in!

You bring your stuff and arrange it the way you want to.

You do it for yourself mostly, but you also don’t mind to
show it off to friends and colleagues. Perhaps bond over a
shared love of Dune when they see it on your bookshelf.

High-performance teams are not staffed by interchangable robots.
We’re each allowed and *expected* to bring our
unique skill and perspective to benefit the team and the people
it’s serving.

That’s why I believe a high-level of customization is
needed. Not only for dry practical purposes but with a bit of
aesthetics and cultural expression.

For *your* team in *your* context:

* What do we like?
* What do we value?
* What is most important here?

Don’t just talk about it. Show it!

## Make The Work Visible (and configure your space around that work)

In a typical creative knowledge work office what we can see,
hear and touch (and in extreme cases also smell) is people
walking around, sitting at desks and talking to each other.

But what are they working on?

Are they building software?

What kind of software?

Who is it for?

How is it working for them?

All that is hidden in various tools that we can interact with
through our screens.

When designing a virtual environment for a high-performance team
— why try to replicate the most boring and irrelevant, or even
hated, parts of legacy office spaces?

We should be able to make the work clearly visible and
**configure our space** to suit the actually
important aspects of that work!

## Situational Awareness

The Agile community popularized the concept of
*information radiators*. Various types of boards, posters
and dashboards that communicate key information making it not
only **accessible on demand** (click-link, wait
several seconds, scroll, absorb) but also
**available at a glance** and
**ambiently discoverable**!

Some high-performance teams went much further.

Think government/military situation rooms or space mission
control:

When moving online every team can enjoy this level of support
for their high-stakes, in-the-moment decision making.

## Foster a learning culture

The most common way people learn is by modeling the behavior of
others (experienced team mates, masters in our domain, leaders
in our org).

When we’re working remotely it’s much harder to
observe how people behave.

But there’s also good news: in our computer-enabled
economy the key decisions are made on screens with keyboards and
mice, so being able to see someone at their desk is not much of
an advantage.

Online we have the opportunity to make what really matters more
visible, so that when it works it can be repeated, copied and
amplified and when it doesn’t it can be corrected or
reimagined.

To enable a learning culture in a distributed setting we need to
make key aspects of the actual work visible.

Not just the people doing it.

## Corner office for everyone

Not all work is urgent, high-preassure and tightly integrated
with real time feedback loops.

Sometimes we need a
**protected space to do some deep work** in or to
**have a quiet conversation** with someone.

Of course we could have h a regular Zoom call, but how might we
make it better?

How can we set the stage for a deep discussion?

[![](https://i1.wp.com/fluidcircle.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/high-perf-team-space-private-office.jpg?resize=640%2C426&ssl=1)](https://i1.wp.com/fluidcircle.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/high-perf-team-space-private-office.jpg?ssl=1&ref=localhost)

Virtual backgrounds are cool, but they’re one sided. We
should have a way to create an environment that is both
optimized to evoke a certain mindset or tone of conversation as
well as one that can be shared by both participants. Preferably
with an ability to look at what the conversation is about.

## Focus is more important than clock-time

High-performance distributed teams need to be able to
**easily and reliably see the meaningful aspects of each
other’s status and activity**
— enough to make key decisions but not too much that it
would obfuscate more than illuminate or intrude on that
person’s privacy.

For example — focus mode:

1. who’s **available to talk right now**?
2. who’s in a meeting and
   **when will they be done**?
3. who’s trying to focus on some deep work (and should not
   be interrupted without a good reason) and
   **when will they be done**?
4. who’s out for the day and
   **when will they be back**?

## Communication needs to adapt to the situation, not overwhelm it

A way to communicate that is high-bandwidth, flexible (combining
various channels) but also adapts to what the team needs in
terms of focus and interactions.

For example:

If I’m in a meeting or focus bubble right now — schedule
other messages from teammates to be delivered after the bubble
pops — and when it does, deliver it using my preferred method
(email, slack, …).
