*Check Your Story*

Have you ever found yourself on one side of a situation like
this?

[Ancient philosophers knew it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave?ref=localhost) and [modern ones developed the idea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_semantics?ref=localhost):

We do NOT have direct access to reality:

1. We **perceive** an extremely small part
   of it using our [limited and unreliable senses](https://www.theoryofknowledge.net/ways-of-knowing/sense-perception/how-reliable-is-the-knowledge-provided-to-us-by-our-senses/?ref=localhost).
2. Then we **interpret the meaning** based
   on our cultural context, past experience, the [vocabulary we wield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity?ref=localhost) and [even our needs and wants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivated_reasoning?ref=localhost).
3. Then do we **decide what to do**.

And that’s an extremely good thing. Otherwise we wouldn’t be
able to function in an extremely complex world.

But *sometimes* it can lead to,

let’s just say,

*suboptimal* results.

As [Caitlin Walker teaches us](https://cleanlanguage.co.uk/articles/articles/272/0/Cleaning-up-the-F-word/Page0.html?ref=localhost):

1. we should be able to distinguish between
   the **evidence** we see or hear
2. and the **inference** – that is
   the story we make up about it

Is your story really the most useful story you could be telling
yourself about the situation?

How would the story change if you [assumed positive intent](https://remoteleader.substack.com/p/be-careful-about-letting-worst-possible?ref=localhost)?

Until next time,

Michał
