<h2>Whose Space is it Anyway?</h2>



<p>What do you do right after you rent a new space?</p>



<p>You move in!</p>



<p>You bring your stuff and arrange it the way you want to.</p>



<p>You do it for yourself mostly, but you also don&#8217;t mind to show it off to friends and colleagues. Perhaps bond over a shared love of Dune when they see it on your bookshelf.</p>



<p>High-performance teams are not staffed by interchangable robots. We&#8217;re each allowed and <em>expected</em> to bring our unique skill and perspective to benefit the team and the people it&#8217;s serving.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why I believe a high-level of customization is needed. Not only for dry practical purposes but with a bit of aesthetics and cultural expression.</p>



<p>For <em>your</em> team in <em>your</em> context:</p>



<ul><li>What do we like?</li><li>What do we value?</li><li>What is most important here?</li></ul>



<p>Don&#8217;t just talk about it. Show it!</p>



<h2>Make The Work Visible (and configure your space around that work)</h2>



<p>In a typical creative knowledge work office what we can see, hear and touch (and in extreme cases also smell) is people walking around, sitting at desks and talking to each other.</p>



<p>But what are they working on?</p>



<p>Are they building software?</p>



<p>What kind of software?</p>



<p>Who is it for?</p>



<p>How is it working for them?</p>



<p>All that is hidden in various tools that we can interact with through our screens.</p>



<p>When designing a virtual environment for a high-performance team — why try to replicate the most boring and irrelevant, or even hated, parts of legacy office spaces?</p>



<p>We should be able to make the work clearly visible and <strong>configure our space</strong> to suit the actually important aspects of that work!</p>



<h2>Situational Awareness</h2>



<p>The Agile community popularized the concept of <em>information radiators</em>. Various types of boards, posters and dashboards that communicate key information making it not only <strong>accessible on demand</strong> (click-link, wait several seconds, scroll, absorb) but also <strong>available at a glance</strong> and <strong>ambiently discoverable</strong>!</p>



<p>Some high-performance teams went much further.</p>



<p>Think government/military situation rooms or space mission control:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/fluidcircle.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-photo-256219.jpeg?ssl=1&ref=localhost"><img loading="lazy" width="900" height="524" src="https://i2.wp.com/fluidcircle.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-photo-256219.jpeg?resize=900%2C524&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-2563" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption>Photo by Pixabay on <a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/men-working-at-night-256219/?ref=localhost" rel="nofollow">Pexels.com</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>When moving online every team can enjoy this level of support for their high-stakes, in-the-moment decision making.</p>



<h2>Foster a learning culture</h2>



<p>The most common way people learn is by modeling the behavior of others (experienced team mates, masters in our domain, leaders in our org).</p>



<p>When we&#8217;re working remotely it&#8217;s much harder to observe how people behave.</p>



<p>But there&#8217;s also good news: in our computer-enabled economy the key decisions are made on screens with keyboards and mice, so being able to see someone at their desk is not much of an advantage.</p>



<p>Online we have the opportunity to make what really matters more visible, so that when it works it can be repeated, copied and amplified and when it doesn&#8217;t it can be corrected or reimagined.</p>



<p>To enable a learning culture in a distributed setting we need to make key aspects of the actual work visible.</p>



<p>Not just the people doing it.</p>



<h2>Corner office for everyone</h2>



<p>Not all work is urgent, high-preassure and tightly integrated with real time feedback loops.</p>



<p>Sometimes we need a <strong>protected space to do some deep work</strong> in or to <strong>have a quiet conversation</strong> with someone.</p>



<p>Of course we could have h a regular Zoom call, but how might we make it better?</p>



<p>How can we set the stage for a deep discussion?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/fluidcircle.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/high-perf-team-space-private-office.jpg?ssl=1&ref=localhost"><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="426" src="https://i1.wp.com/fluidcircle.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/high-perf-team-space-private-office.jpg?resize=640%2C426&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-2566" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></figure>



<p>Virtual backgrounds are cool, but they&#8217;re one sided. We should have a way to create an environment that is both optimized to evoke a certain mindset or tone of conversation as well as one that can be shared by both participants. Preferably with an ability to look at what the conversation is about.</p>



<h2>Focus is more important than clock-time</h2>



<p>High-performance distributed teams need to be able to <strong>easily and reliably see the meaningful aspects of each other&#8217;s status and activity</strong> &#8212; enough to make key decisions but not too much that it would obfuscate more than illuminate or intrude on that person&#8217;s privacy.</p>



<p>For example — focus mode:</p>



<ol><li>who&#8217;s <strong>available to talk right now</strong>?</li><li>who&#8217;s in a meeting and <strong>when will they be done</strong>?</li><li>who&#8217;s trying to focus on some deep work (and should not be interrupted without a good reason) and <strong>when will they be done</strong>?</li><li>who&#8217;s out for the day and <strong>when will they be back</strong>?</li></ol>



<h2>Communication needs to adapt to the situation, not overwhelm it</h2>



<p>A way to communicate that is high-bandwidth, flexible (combining various channels) but also adapts to what the team needs in terms of focus and interactions.</p>



<p>For example:</p>



<p>If I&#8217;m in a meeting or focus bubble right now — schedule other messages from teammates to be delivered after the bubble pops — and when it does, deliver it using my preferred method (email, slack, &#8230;).</p>
